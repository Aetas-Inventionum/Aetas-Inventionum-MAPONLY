#Absolutism Tweaks
absolutism = {
	stability_cost_modifier = -0.2			#BTAddOn added. Compensation for losing the Admin Efficiency and offsets higher global unrest. Also just logical sense... Note to self, watch out for stability cost reduction stacking, and perhaps do some number crunching soon.
	administrative_efficiency = 0.2			#BTAddOn changed from 0.4. Too exploitable, moving the 0.1 of the lost 0.2 back into tech.
	production_efficiency = 0.2			#BTAddOn added. Compensation for losing the Admin efficiency, and also just logical sense... the description even says absolutism is how 'efficient' the government is. (Plus, 1.25 cut 0.3 from tech)
	#discipline = 0.05			#BTAddOn removed. I see why this is here and appreciate the reasoning, but upon extensive consideration, I want to keep discipline out of absolutism. Absolute governments can have well trained, well drilled troops, but it can also be the sort of government that treats soldiers as fodder. Moving this bonus to professionalism, for what should be obvious reasons.
	all_power_cost	= -0.05			#BTAddOn added. Very powerful compensation for losing Admin Efficiency, hopefully putting to rest any whining about that. Note again, the description of absolutism does read 'how efficient' the government is, so this seems fitting.
	#global_unrest = 10			#BTAddOn added. Further disuading exploitation and just makes logical sense... the description even says absolutism is how 'ruthless' the government is. BR Cut to replace with estate loyalty equilibrium
	#core_decay_on_your_own = -0.5			#BTAddOn removed. This is a fun idea that I might have to use elsewhere, but I'm just not seeing the link here with absolute governments specifically.
	
	#I feel the idea behind absolutism is relegating all power away from, well, the estates of the realm, leaving the Monarch absolute. As such, estates should definitely become disloyal. This also makes a lot more sense mechanically, since now the player has a lot more control over how they handle their state. If they run headfirst into high absolutism with highly influential estates, they will definitely run into issues, what with them turning disloyal. As well, unrest will naturally rise as estates become disloyal at high absolutism, and other modifiers will have a degree of impact to try and offset Absolutism's bonuses.

	jains_loyalty_modifier = -0.20 #BTIP Added. I have pondered to split between -10% for Hindu indians and -20% for Muslim indians. However, there's no loyalty modifier to do this in vanilla, and I like the symmetry of all Indian nations having -20% loyalty.

	peasants_loyalty_modifier = -0.10 #BTIP Added: Peasants estate. There is an argument that this shouldn't be here given that historically Absolutism granted the peasants more power relatively, but I think halving it works nicely.
