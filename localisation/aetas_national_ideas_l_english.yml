 marchigiano_ideas_bonus:0 "Marchigiano Ambition"
 mrch_first:0 "Marca Anconitana e Fermana"
 mrch_first_desc:0 "Present day Marche is the amalgamation of three entities: the March of Ancona, the March of Fermo, and parts of Pentapolis - an old Byzantine administration, though former marches had also existed in the region before. They existed at the defensive frontier of the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States, facing Saracen raids, Norman Aggression, and beyond."
 mrch_second:0 "Arrival of the Holy House"
 mrch_second_desc:0 "Every 9th of December, Marche comes together to feast in the name of Our Lady of Loreto and to celebrate the translation of the Holy House. In additions to feasting and festivities, great bonfires are erected come nightfall and the protection of the Virgin Mary, the Gate of Heaven, and the Morning Star are invoked. This act is reminiscent of the fires used to light the Holy House's way to Loreto from Macerata."
 mrch_third:0 "Rector of Ancona"
 mrch_third_desc:0 "Despite their title, the Rectors were the Papal provincial governors of all Marche and had direct contact with the Pontiff. At first this role was carried out from Ancona, but later the 'Rector' would move to Fermo, and finally Macerata due to shifts in Papal loyalty. This figure served under the authority of the General Rector who reported directly to the pope. "
 mrch_fourth:0 "Mount of Piety"
 mrch_fourth_desc:0 "In 1458, the first 'pawnbroker' opened in Ascoli Piceno as a charitable workaround to usury laws, notably accessible to people of lower social status and operated by the Catholic Church. They were a 'benevolent' workaround to exploitative lending where borrowers had to provide valuables as collateral for non-payment, and the loan would be two-thirds the value of said valuables. Interest was then, in theory, used exclusively to fund the operation of the Mount. This institution would eventually spread across Marche & Lazio, then Italy and further."
 mrch_fifth:0 "Renaissance Development"
 mrch_fifth_desc:0 "Much like the rest of Italy during the Renaissance, the region of Marche developed rapidly during this period both politically and economically. Literary societies, new industries, rapid expansion of public and private infrastructure, and significant papal investment would all come together to create a new Marche for the early modern era."
 mrch_sixth:0 "Giacomo Leopardi"
 mrch_sixth_desc:0 "A philosopher, poet, essayist, and more, Leopardi is regarded as one of the greatest minds to have ever originated from Italy. His work often reflected on existence and human existence, cited as a principal pillar of literary romanticism. Contemporaries described his work as opening, and probing, every scratch wound of the suffering humanity."
 mrch_seventh:0 "Industrial Competence"
 mrch_seventh_desc:0 "Fabriano, an unassuming town near Macerata, is known for producing some of the finest paper in Europe -- introduced to them by Arabs in the 13th century. As the Industrial Revolution entered full swing, the people of Marche took to these new methods as if they were born to do so! Not just with paper, but in all manners even going so far as creating the modern shoemaking process. The art is so prolific that an entire region of Marche would become known as 'Shoe Valley'."

 RAN_ideas:0 "Tarantino Ideas"
 RAN_ideas_start:0 "Tarantino Traditions"
 RAN_ideas_bonus:0 "Tarantino Ambition"
 ran_first:0 "Norman Principality"
 ran_first_desc:0 "The origins of our beloved principality stem from its naissance under Norman rule. The Principality of Taranto of old united with Calabria to eventually form the mighty Kingdom of Sicily under which we have ourselves been ruled. Since the creation of the kingdom, the Principality of Taranto has been given out as a fief of great prestige and most often the most powerful of all fiefs within the kingdom. Thus, can none compete with our extensive connections and resources."
 ran_second:0 "Orsini Del Balzo's Ambition"
 ran_second_desc:0 "The apogee of Tarantino influence in the 14th and 15th centuries was reached by the charismatic Orsini Del Balzo dynasty, lead by Raimondo and then his son Giovanni Antonio. Raimondo's Taranto became the largest fief in Naples, and even following its large dismantlement upon his death, his son and Count of Lecce Giovanni Antonio was quick to restore the fruits of his father's labors and grew the principality into its greatest size. It was the raw ambition of the Orsini Del Balzo that drove Taranto to new heights of power."
 ran_third:0 "Mar Piccolo e Mar Grande"
 ran_third_desc:0 "The city of Taranto is blessed enough to have two bays: the Mar Grande, where the commercial port can be found, and the Mar Piccolo where the ancient Greek colony of Taranto was once located. These bays allow Taranto to safely shelter a large number of ships, far more than any normal port, and earned the city its nickname "City of the Two Seas"."
 ran_fourth:0 "Turks on the Horizon"
 ran_fourth_desc:0 "While Taranto is sheltered by the rest of Salento the danger of the Ottoman fleet one day arriving at our door hangs over the population at all times. With the rumors of Ottoman attacks along the Apulian coast, we must be prepared to defend our settlement at all costs."
 ran_fifth:0 "Isabella di Taranto"
 ran_fifth_desc:0 "The first wife of King of Naples Ferdinand I, Queen Isabella de Clermont was beloved by the people of the kingdom, and especially by the populace of Taranto where she and Ferdinand ruled prior to becoming King and Queen. Isabella was given the epithet "of Taranto" due to her longtime respect and admiration of Taranto during her time there."
 ran_sixth:0 "Despotatus Romaniae"
 ran_sixth_desc:0 "Through the Tocchi, the Princes of Taranto possessed a claim to the Epirote Despotate, the Despotatus Romaniae. Although we may never even set foot in Epirus let alone Greece, the title brings us great prestige."
 ran_seventh:0 "From Taranto to Naples"
 ran_seventh_desc:0 "The power of Taranto once suffocated the Kingdom of Naples with its grip on the lands, holding so many estates that it was said that the Prince of Taranto could travel from Taranto straight to Naples without ever setting foot outside of his domain. Such a pinnacle will never be forgotten by Tarantinos, for we are destined to once again dominate Southern Italy."

 AZZ_ideas:0 "Abruzzese Ideas"
 AZZ_ideas_start:0 "Abruzzese Traditions" 
 AZZ_ideas_bonus:0 "Abruzzese Ambition"
 azz_first:0 "Frontier of the Kingdom"
 azz_first_desc:0 "From the days of the Lombards to the hey-day of the Angevin regime of Naples, Abruzzo has been the battleground of Central Italy as the natural convergence point of several great powers in the region. Our mountainous geography composed of the Appennines makes things even more brutal, and we must best embrace our position at the frontiers of the kingdom."
 azz_second:0 "Justiciarship of Abruzzo"
 azz_second_desc:0 "The name "Abruzzo" is first officially acknowledged upon the founding of an eponymous Lombard justiciarship, and marks the beginning of true Abruzzese regional identity which is neither strictly Neapolitna nor Umbrian."
 azz_third:0 "Saffron Guilds of L'Aquila"
 azz_third_desc:0 "The prominent center of Abruzzo prior to the emergence of Chieti in that role, L'Aquila hosted a unique industry: the cultivation and trade of saffron. Introduced to the area from Spain in the 13th century, saffron quickly became the primary source of income for L'Aquila. After its dissemination from the local monks who first grew saffron, merchants began organizing into guilds dedicated to ensuring the quality of saffron."
 azz_fourth:0 "Abruzzese Condottieri Talents"
 azz_fourth_desc:0 "Abruzzo's position nurtures the finest of military talent in Italy, all greedily hired as condottieri captains to carry out their respective client sovereign's bidding. Some of the most well remembered of our condottieri is, without a doubt, the infamous Andrea Braccio da Montone, a powerful man who effectively carved out his own proper realm in Umbria and was the Pope's most powerful weapon."
 azz_fifth:0 "Coastal Towers"
 azz_fifth_desc:0 "As Berber piracy became more and more deadly over the years, a greater focus has been allocated to defending our coastlines. Reaching even Abruzzo, grand coastal towers were constructed on the orders of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to better defend our coastal population and our waters."
 azz_sixth:0 "Seismic Catastrophe"
 azz_sixth_desc:0 "The Appennines are victim to vicious seismic activity, and Abruzzo is no exception. Several times have our towns been devastated by destructive earthquakes and so many left without home to return to because of it. Us Abruzzese must adapt to these circumstances, or else shall we continue to fall victim to nature's wrath."
 azz_seventh:0 "Brigandage: A Lifestyle"
 azz_seventh_desc:0 "Throughout several long periods of Abruzzese history, brigandage ran rampant throughout the region. Largely due to the string of wars along our borders, peasants were seemingly forced to become bandits and brigands, raiding and looting the surrounding areas to feed themselves and their families and ultimately survive. It is so that brigandage became a lifestyle in Abruzzo and ultimately a worst-case measure to look after our own."

 CBR_ideas:0 "Calabrian Ideas"
 CBR_ideas_start:0 "Calabrian Traditions"
 CBR_ideas_bonus:0 "Calabrian Ambition"
 cbr_first:0 "Mulberry Abduction"
 cbr_first_desc:0 "If you were to ask any fellow Calabrian on what is most dear to the region, they will tell you it is the mulberry trees. These mulberry trees are the single most important ingredient in Calabria's famous production of raw silk, as silkworms feast upon and live within them. These mulberry trees were not from Calabria in origin, but rather they hail from Greece; it was in the midst of the Second Crusade that King Roger II of Sicily launched several brutal attacks on the Central Greek cities of Corinth and Thebes, respective centers of the silk industry in Greek Romania. Ever since these Greek artisans were brought back and settled in Calabria in the 12th century have we proudly produced the most raw silk of all."
 cbr_second:0 "Barlaam of Seminara"
 cbr_second_desc:0 "Well before the arrival of the Latin Romans, there were Greeks living on the coasts of Calabria in their ancient colonies. This Greek substratum never disappeared, resurging once again while under Eastern Roman rule prior to Norman conquest. This presence of Greek culture is best encompassed by Barlaam of Seminara, a local Italiot Griko monk and influential humanist who championed the Byzantine rites in his native Calabria. His works in philosophy, theology and translation aimed to bridge the widening schism between Orthodox and Catholic churches, bringing improved synthesis of both within his home region."
 cbr_third:0 "Dissemination of Sericultural Mastery"
 cbr_third_desc:0 "So skilled is our sericulture that the great powers of Europe seek to emulate our processes and success. One such example is the work of Jean le Calabrais (John the Calabrian) who is celebrated for singlehandedly introducing the silk industry to Lyon, France, where it was to remain for the following centuries and beyond. Indeed, it was there in the late 15th century that Jean le Calabrais invented a new machine that could weave silken yarn even faster than before, forever changing the nature of sericulture."
 cbr_fourth:0 "Rugged Hills of Calabria"
 cbr_fourth_desc:0 "The geography of Calabria is mostly defined by her dramatic and rugged hills which dive into the seaside. It is amongst these hills that we are able to make the most out of our homeland, however, for while they loom so do they shelter and nurture us. For, even despite the seemingly difficult terrain which we inhabit has Calabria always been a demographic anchor for the Kingdom of Naples and our population always steadily growing and economy increasing."
 cbr_fifth:0 "La Guardia"
 cbr_fifth_desc:0 "From the 14th century onwards, our isolated valleys amongst the rugged hills have attracted all sorts of migrating refugee groups including the Waldensians who sought sanctuary just northwest of Cosenza in what is called 'la Guardia Piemontese' since they largely came from Piedmont. These Waldensians became so numerous that their language, Occitain, still persists as the local tongue in its respective locality."
 cbr_sixth:0 "Gregorian Calendar"
 cbr_sixth_desc:0 "It should be a surprise to none that of all possible places to have produced a mind that could author the Gregorian Calendar that it was Calabria. Luigi Lillo, also known as Aloysius Lilius, a Calabrian, is concretely credited for having been the primary author of the modern Gregorian Calendar in its proposal of 1582. His legacy lasts forever, as western perception of time can be credited to his thought, brilliance and genius."
 cbr_seventh:0 "Calabrian Traffic"
 cbr_seventh_desc:0 "Our local silk industry attracts foreign merchants from all across the Mediterranean Sea. From Genoa, to Pisa, to Venice and Constantinople do all sorts of merchants come to make business with us to purchase our beautiful silk. Hence, does our name get around and opens several doors on the seas, granting us access to the most lucrative and safest of trade passages in order to properly ship our goods."
 
 SLR_ideas:0 "Salernitano Ideas"
 SLR_ideas_start:0 "Salernitano Traditions"
 SLR_ideas_bonus:0 "Salernitano Ambition"
 slr_first:0 "Hippocratica civitas"
 slr_first_desc:0 "The nickname "Hippocratica civitas", meaning "the city of Hippocrates" was attributed to Salerno for its famous medical school: the Schola Medica Salernitana which was established in the 9th century AD. This school awarded some of the very first professional and certified doctorates in Europe and was indisputably the center for the study of medicine,science, and the translation of Arabic and Greek documents into Latin for both men and women. Although it slowly lost its importance over the centuries, it still continued to operate and provide important education until its dissolution in 1811."
 slr_second:0 "Principato Citra"
 slr_second_desc:0 "The traditional Principality of Salerno spans the entirety of the Principato Citra and Salerno itself as its capital. Our local knowledge of the province from its farmlands to its rugged hills provides us a grand advantage in not only administering the area to the best of our ability but also in defending it against potential adversaries."
 slr_third:0 "Opulenta Salernum"
 slr_third_desc:0 "In order to pay off large sums of debt, monarchs of Naples frequently sold the Principality of Salerno to many different noble families, from the Colonnas to, most famously, the Sanseverinos. The Sanseverinos oversaw the development of Salerno into becoming a princely capital, encompassing the splendor and magnificence of the Italian Renaissance."
 slr_fourth:0 "Old Norman Cradle"
 slr_fourth_desc:0 "It cannot be forgotten that Salerno was the cradle for the Norman Duchy of Apulia and Calabria which united Southern Italy and Sicily into the grand Kingdom of Sicily. Until Palermo was made their capital, it was Salerno which was the seat for the Norman dukes. As a consequence, their mighty castles still stand as a reminder of our past glories."
 slr_fifth:0 "Tax on Silk in Cilento"
 slr_fifth_desc:0 "Among the most prized and lucrative privileges accompanying the Principality of Salerno was certainly the right to the taxes on silk in the Cilento region. These taxes were responsible for singlehandedly filling much of the coffers of its respective princes who encouraged the flourishing of the sericulture industry."
 slr_sixth:0 "Saint Matthew's Protection"
 slr_sixth_desc:0 "Salerno has long been a center for the reveration of the blessed apostle Saint Matthew the Evangelist for being his final resting place. It was only in the mid 16th century, however, that he was finally adopted as the patron saint of Salerno. This is because upon the approach of a hostile Ottoman fleet lead by Barbarossa and bent on sacking the city was destroyed by a storm. This miracle was considered by locals to be an act of Saint Matthew, henceforth solidifying Saint Matthew's status as Salerno's patron saint and portrayed on the city's own coat of arms after 1574."
 slr_seventh:0 "Defense of the Parthenopean Republic"
 slr_seventh_desc:0 "At the close of the 18th century in 1799, the Kingdom of Naples was host to one of the many revolutions of the period: the establishment of the short-lived Neapolitan Republic, also known as the Parthenopean Republic. Lead by the charismatic revolutionary Ferdinando Ruggi d'Aragona and his brother Antonio, Salerno hailed the cries for help of the republic and came to her defense."

 ANC_ideas_bonus:0 "Anconan Ambition"
 ANC_ideas_start:0 "Anconan Traditions"
 anc_cathedral:0 "The Ancona Cathedral"
 anc_cathedral_desc:0 "The Ancona Cathedral, dedicated to the city's patron, Saint Cyriacus, a bishop of Ancona killed during pilgrimage to the Holy Lands in 360, during one of the last waves of anti-Christian violence in the Roman Empire, and of the men who supposedly found the True Cross, is a masterpiece of medieval architecture, combining Romansque, Byzantine and Gothic elements, built during 20 years at the turn of the millennium. Made out of the white stone of the nearby Mount Conero, it's a testament to our city's wealth and prestige."
 anc_constructions_clement_xii:0 "Constructions of Clement XII"
 anc_constructions_clement_xii_desc:0 "During the 18th century mandate of pope Clement XII, Ancona was a target of major construction work, with the city's quay being extended, an imitation of the Trajan arch built in the city to honour emperor in 155 by the senate and people of Rome, and a Lazaretto, a quarantine station for maritime travelers being built."
 anc_cosmopolitan_city:0 "Cosmopolitan City"
 anc_cosmopolitan_city_desc:0 "Ancona was always a diverse city, ever since its founding by Greek colonists from Syracuse in Picenii lands in 387 BC. A Greek community has remained in the city, with as many as 200 families in the 16th century. It was an important destination for Ottoman merchants in Italy as well. Ancona was also the only city in the Papal states bar Rome and Avignon themselves that was allowed to keep a Jewish community within its walls."
 anc_maritime_republic:0 "Maritime Republic"
 anc_maritime_republic_desc:0 "Though not as powerful or well known as the great republics of Venice and Genoa, the Maritime Republic of Ancona far outlasted those of Amalfi, Gaeta and even the mighty Pisa, only falling in 1532. One of the reasons for this success is the long time partnership it had with Ragusa on the other side of Adriatic, fighting against the influence of Venice."
 anc_not_a_seignory:0 "Not a Seignory"
 anc_not_a_seignory_desc:0 "Unlike many other Italian cities, Ancona kept true to its republican ways, never falling into domination of one of the city's many noble families, a reppublicca rather than seignoria. We can be proud to say that, outside of a brief rule of Rimini's Malatesta, no man but the Pope, God's representative on Earth, has called himself the Lord of Ancona!"
 anc_staunch_guelphs:0 "Staunch Guelphs"
 anc_staunch_guelphs_desc:0 "Ancona never had any love for lords, but it never had any love for the emperor either. The city always supported the Pope, and was well rewarded by protection from it's ambitious neighbors."
 anc_trade_metropol:0 "Trade Metropol"
 anc_trade_metropol_desc:0 "The city's many communities and alliance with Ragusa both went a long way in making it a trade metropol, and the largest Adriatic port south of Venice. The long history as a maritime republic also helps our merchants around the world."

 modicani_ideas_start:0 "Modicani Traditions"
 modicani_ideas_bonus:0 "Modicani Ambition"
 modi_first:0 "The Delights of Life"
 modi_first_desc:0 "Modica's territory is that of great fertility. From the grasses that give out a hundredfold, to the vineyards, groves, and gardens that grow green year round, and to the pleasant, suburban homes with happy pastures that nourish the district with herds of all kinds there is nothing the people of Modica want for."
 modi_second:0 "Regnum in Regno"
 modi_second_desc:0 "In the late 14th century, Modica was granted to new lords and, with that, was granted unparalleled rights and autonomy. Most notably it was designated as a seat of the Grand Court Tribunal, and even its own Tribunal of Second Instance -- a right not even Palermo had. Though even beyond this, it had broad lesser rights such as its own police force, governors, and its own codified Customs of Modica - civil and legal penal norms. Together, this resulted in Modica being one of the most powerful Mezzogiorno feuds and equal to the Sicilian Kings."
 modi_third:0 "Modicana Bulls"
 modi_third_desc:0 "The oldest of the Sicilian breeds of cattle, the famous red-coated bovines hold triple-purpose. First for labour, with their strong limbs and claws. Second for milk, prized for its uses in Sicilian cheeses from Ragusano to Iblea Ricotta. Third for meat, though it produces little it is sought after nonetheless for its intense red colours. They find their ancestry in all places, from Africa to Sardinia to Sicily - a true follower of the Sicilian legacy."
 modi_fourth:0 "Emphyteusis"
 modi_fourth_desc:0 "After being condemned to pay an unassailable fine, the lord Bernardo Giovanni was forced to sell land en masse to the people of Modica. The result of this was the distribution of land to the bourgeoisie, two centuries earlier than wider Sicily. This meant the wealthiest peasants became landowners who held their land in emphyteutic leases - with obligations to improve it on the state's behalf."
 modi_fifth:0 "A History with Admirals"
 modi_fifth_desc:0 "At every stage of Modica's countyship has it been ruled by experienced admiral or by those who held that position within the overseeing kingdom. First the Count Gualtiero, but also every Chiaramontan ruler, the Aragonese Bernardo Cabrero, and his descendants. Though not every Admiral title was necessarily admiral in practice, it is undeniable that the sea is part of Modica's blood. "
 modi_sixth:0 "City of Hercules"
 modi_sixth_desc:0 "Sometime after the 17th century arose a tale about the theft of the hero Hercules' red oxen, a trophy from defeating the giant Geryon. Three women informed the Hero as to where the oxen were stolen away to, and in these places of information he founded three cities - Mozia by Cape Lilbeo, Mozia by Arigentio, and finally Mozia by Pachino... now known as Modica."
 modi_seventh:0 "Sicilian Baroque"
 modi_seventh_desc:0 "After the 1693 Val di Noto Earthquake, in which entire cities were razed, Modica was rebuilt in one of the final flourishes of Baroque architecture. Though the viceroy of Palermo disagreed with the effort, Modicani spirit prevailed and the reconstruction was both rapid and efficient sparing no effort to reimagine the city in beautiful, contemporary style. In just three years the city cathedral was open, in eleven every church was reopened. Modica prevails."

 romagnolo_ideas_bonus:0 "Romagnolo Ambition"
 romg_first:0 "A Closeness to Rome"
 romg_first_desc:0 "On several occasions has Romagna held importance in the various iterations of Rome, once as the home of its de facto capital and later as hub of a wealthy exarchate. This history is a part of the region down to its very name and the foundations of countless urban centres."
 romg_second:0 "Papal in Name Only"
 romg_second_desc:0 "For centuries the Papacy struggled to reign in the various states and vicarates in Romagna. Though they held influence, and even total power at times, this state of affairs was in constant flux with the people of Romagna being fiercely self-deterministic."
 romg_third:0 "Municipal Communes"
 romg_third_desc:0 "During the medieval period, many cities in Italy were organised by an alliance of the people within them rather than lords without them. In theory havens of par-democracy, council rule, and self-determination, this method of governance dominates the politics of Romagna from the ocean to the mountains."
 romg_fourth:0 "Ramgnolo Painting Schools"
 romg_fourth_desc:0 "Forli and Rimini were both hubs to their own schools of painting. It is said that the Riminese artistic style was born in a single moment, by the visitation of one Giotto di Bondone when he notably produced a Crucifix and a variety of frescoes. Closely in link, even as a direct influence for Rimini, was the Forlivese school whose most prominent pupil was a Melozzo da Forli - a pioneer of third-dimension perspective in art."
 romg_fifth:0 "By Nature, Violent"
 romg_fifth_desc:0 "The lords of Romagna are, in spite of efforts from outside forces, volatile and ever-open to taking their conflicts to the battlefield and the families of the cities refuse to take a passive role in the game of Guelphs and Ghibellines - be the dispute Papal or Habsburg."
 romg_sixth:0 "Faenza Majolica"
 romg_sixth_desc:0 "Majolica, pottery produced in a tin-glaze process, produced in Faenza is regarded as the finest of its kind in the world. From an alliance of centuries-long traditions and the wealthy benefaction of Florentine nobles came gloriously expressive designs in the Garofano style known in the region."
 romg_seventh:0 "Archibugieri"
 romg_seventh_desc:0 "With a passion of love do the craftsmen of Romagna produce not just weapons of war, but true, artisanal arquebus manufactory. From perfect grains of wood, to the highest quality steel, and intricate, beautiful designs, the guns of Romagna outpace that of any of our neighbours or rivals."

 tts_first:0 "Regnum Utriusque Siciliæ"
 tts_first_desc:0 "Although initially united, since the 13th century have the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, both formerly Sicily, been seperated both politically, legally and institutionally. While these two nascent kingdoms could not be any more different in character, the memory of the once joined Kingdom of both Sicilies was never forgotten; when he finally conquered the jewel of his eye, Naples, in 1443 did King Alfonso I thus become master of both kingdoms, titling himself 'Rex Utriusque Siciliæ', meaning King of Both Sicilies. Now, again has the union been revived but now solidly in reality rather than memory."
 tts_second:0 "Royal Navy of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"
 tts_second_desc:0 "Surrounded by the shores of the Mediterranean, it should be no surprise that the Royal Navy of the Two Sicilies was the strongest in Italy, prompting even other developing naval programs from countries such as Sardinia to study our traditions and methods. Our naval doctrines and strength were further reinforced by the establishment of several nautical schools throughout the kingdom and the expansion of docks in virtually every port in order to support a truly modern and grand navy."
 tts_third:0 "Sicilian Granary"
 tts_third_desc:0 "Heavily produced in Sicily and Apulia, wheats, grains, cereals and olive oil was a major sector of the Dual Sicilian economy and a cornerstone to our prosperity. In time, grain from the Two Sicilies became the most popularily imported grain in all of Europe, competing with the likes of even Russia or Poland."
 tts_fourth:0 "Naples Stock Exchange"
 tts_fourth_desc:0 "The creation of the Naples Stock Exchange saw a boom in trade activity in Naples which quickly became one of the busiest ports in the Mediterranean Sea along with Palermo and Messina. Merchants and investors from all over the world are allured by what the Two Sicilies have to offer."
 tts_fifth:0 "Napoleonic Model"
 tts_fifth_desc:0 "Following the conquest of the Kingdom of Naples by the forces of Napoleon, a new army was created following his model. Our new, regular standing army was highly professionalized and standardized according to Napoleon's own rigid expectations, but were more often known by their elaborate uniforms rather than any of their accomplishments. However, the creation of the army represented the culmination of one of the goals of later Naples: to reduce the amount of old nobility in the military echelon, allowing for any and all talent to enter the ranks of the military."
 tts_sixth:0 "Sicula Transatlantica"
 tts_sixth_desc:0 "With the creation of the Naples Stock Exchange and the new emphasis on our maritime traditions, it was natural that our eyes began to gaze onto the greater Atlantic ocean. As a result of the insistence of a Sicilian shipping company in Palermo, the very first voyage directly from Italy to the Americas by steamboat was accomplished when the ship, the Sicilia, docked in New York city. As global trade begins to unfold, we must follow this example to pursue our connection to the world's many markets."
 tts_seventh:0 "Legge fondamentale del Regno delle Due Sicilie"
 tts_seventh_desc:0 "The "Legge fondamentale del Regno delle Due Sicilie", meaning the "Fundamental Law of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies" was officially proclaimed on the 8th of December, 1816 and abolished the independent laws of Sicily, thus merging the island and the penninsular realm into one sole entity for the first time in several centuries: the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, never again to be seperated until the dissolution of the kingdom following the Expedition of the Thousand."

 tts_liber_desc:0 "Cited as one of the greatest works of law in the Middle Ages, the Liber Augustalis, also known as the Constitutions of Melfi, was a law code based on Norman and Roman law instituted in the Hohenstaufen Kingdom of Sicily in 1231 at the castle in Melfi. The constitutions saw the beginning of a slow process of centralization within the Kingdoms of Sicily by forwarding greater power to the central monarchy and its ministries and magistrates at the expense of the local nobility. So influential was it that the Liber Augustalis was maintained in Sicily until 1819."
 tts_sic_revolutions:0 "Sicilian Revolutions"
 tts_sic_revolutions_desc:0 "Even when united under Naples to form the Two Sicilies, the Sicilian spirit was not forgotten and, rather, echoed even more strongly through the island. Sicily's motto, "Animus Tuus Dominus", encompasses the free spirit of Sicilians which fueled their drive for several revolutions against their ruling state in the name of securing their rights and liberties."
 tts_mafia:0 "Emergence of the Sicilian Mafia"
 tts_mafia_desc:0 "In reaction to the persistence of feudalism in a modernizing world, the Sicilian mafia was born in the 17th and 18th centuries. With a goal of destroying the fiefs and nobility which enforced such feudal societal rules, the mafia became a part of Sicilian life from then on, not disappearing ever since."

 nap_noxias_herbas_desc:0 "Noxias herbas, meaning "noxious herbs" was the unofficial motto of the Kingdom of Naples following Charles I d'Anjou's rise to power upon the throne. The motto possibly references the removal of the Swabian "weed" by the Angevins who are symbolically known by the placement of a label or a rake on their coat of arms. Regardless, the motto persisted through the many diverse regimes ruling in Naples from the Angevins to the Aragonese and the Spanish, continuing ever still to represent our kingdom."
 nap_first:0 "Grand Admirality of Naples"
 nap_first_desc:0 "The history of Naples, well before the arrival of the Angevin dynasty, was defined by the sea. First being founded as a Greek colony, Naples has been subject to maritime invasion from the Romans, East Romans, Normans, Saracens, and finally ourselves the Angevins. The sea is indeed the doorway to our Kingdom, and is exactly the reason why the position of Grand Admiral under the Monarch has held great influence and importance within the Kingdom. The Grand Admiral was charged with the maintenance of a Royal navy which defended the ports of Naples." 
 nap_second:0 "City of the Renaissance"
 nap_second_desc:0 "Under Alfons I the Magnanimous, Naples experienced a boom in Renaissance culture and humanism which began its Golden Age. This was best exemplified by the establishment of the University of Naples by King Alfons in 1443, beginning as an informal organization of scholars which met in the Castel Nuovo.

Ever since this concession as a result of the Peace of Caltabellota in 1302, these two Sicilies have remained seperate in name and respective laws.

However, the creation of the army #represented the culmination of one of the goals of later Naples: to reduce the amount of old nobility in the military echelon, allowing for any and all talent to enter the ranks of the military."

So, has feudalism been engrained alongside strong religious identity, creating a unique mix of both within the traditional scope of Limousin."

Later in history, even the house of Rohan inherits estates nearby. The legacy and influence from Brittany is best seen in our popular banner of arms, laden with hermines inherited directly from Brittany."

 lim_third_desc:0 "From the 12th-14th centuries, the most prized and profitable of exports from the region of Limousin was most certainly the émaux champlevés, or the practice of decorating with enamels. Although dying out as a popular practice by the 15th century due to a change in demand and its overall difficulty, the practice is once again revived through a new technique inventined in the 1470s of painting enamel. So, does Limoges take its place once again as the indisputable center of enameling."

This all changes, however, with the arrival of Turgot, the Secretary of the Navy and General Controller of Finances during the reign of Louis XVI, to serve as intendent of Limoges. With his ambitious vision, he ordered the construction of a vast network of roads throughout all of Limousin to improve local infrastructure, placing Limousin back on the map and sparked the beginning of a period of economic prosperity for Limousin and the creation of many new industries there."

The Lüneburger Sate was a treaty and contract between the claimant Princes of Lüneburg of both Ascanian and Welf descent, granting them 50,000 marks in return for granting privileges and autonomies to their estates. While the effectiveness of this treaty is up for debate, it sets the tone for Lüneburg's identity in the coming centuries and provides a fine work of constituionalism, even at the expense of our righteous princes."

Ever since being driven out in 1379, our Princes and Dukes have been staying at Celle, a humble settlement along the Aller river.

This wealth derives from our unique cloths, the Barchent, which is a mix of cotten and linen. We only trade the finest of barchent, for each must have its quality verified with a seal of Ulm.

To this goal did Friedrich II begin operations concerning the draining of the neighboring swamps and expansion of the Berliner Residenz, but the citizens were less than pleased with our interference.

Although he was forced to combat those of the same faith, he managed to acquire for the Albertine Wettins political superiority in Saxony and the title of Elector, bringing security and prosperity to his domain.

This, along with the rapid advancement in Portuguese naval science, has brought with it some interesting adaptions made to our caravels and trade ships. Referred to as 'Nau', Portuguese trade ships beginning in the 15th century were popularily equipped with cannons for the very first time, and combined with the capacity for maneouvering of the caraval, made these naus a deadly force to be reckoned with on the high seas and more than enough to deal with petty pirates."

Since 1295, our two countries have been bound by the Auld Alliance, a defensive pact against the aggressive Kingdom of England. This has lead to a very affectionate relationship between our two Kingdoms, even with many Scots serving the French during the Hundred Years' War against England."

In 1496, in an effort to increase literacy, the Education Act was passed which deeply encouraged the children of all nobility to go to grammar school at the very least. This attention to the letters culminated to a powerful and blooming rate of literacy in Scotland, and to many great inventors who impacted the world greatly."

It can be said that this desire for greater centralization of power hailed from Scotland, where countless struggles and plots have been had between our Kings of Scots and local Earls."

Beginning with the establishment of the Medici bank in 1394 by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, the list of accomplishments and expanse of influence of the Medici is never-ending. Powerful Lords of Florence such as Cosimo, Lorenzo and Cosimo I de' Medici defined the nature of the Florentine Republic, whose bottomless coffers tested the limits of the boundaries of Florentine power."

His efforts were focused on the institutions of the government and passed significant reforms of the Cort, which had become something resembling even the parliament of England in its meritocratic nature.

Although the ordinance may appear minimal at first, the ripples of such a decree spurred the power of the monarchy, united now under one language in an attempt to reduce the autonomy of its Princes and local cultures, each which spoke their own languages.

 mam_sixth:0 "Social Contract"
 mam_sixth_desc:0 "Despite being ruled by foreign rulers for centuries, the Egyptian and Syrian populations have tolerated the Mamluk regimes due to a sort of social contract begun by local Sultans and Caliphs with the Mamluks dating to the 7th century. It was believed that, due to the mamluks' foreign origin, they owed no loyalty to anyone but their masters and the state. Although mamluks were often making contact with their lands of origin, particularily the Burji mamluks with their Circassian homeland and families.
