 aetas_nav.1.d:0 "Since the end of the Reconquista in the Riviera region, or Erriberra in Basque, Tutera has been host to large communities of Sephardic Jews and Moorish Muslims who have been, by the grace of the Kings and Queens of Navarre, guaranteed their rights and liberties throughout their stay. However, the previous treaty guaranteeing such rights has lately expired, and now the monarchs of Navarre must decide once more the status of these families. Shall we allow them to stay with their liberties in tact, bringing us their skills and craftsmanship? Or will we expel them to the pleasure of our Catholic neighbors?"
 aetas_nav.1.a:0 "Those of Tutera belong there, now and forever."

 aetas_nav.2.t:0 "Fateful Marriage"
 aetas_nav.2.d:0 "Blanka, due to outliving her legitimate brothers to become the sole heiress to the Kingdom of Navarre, has been the popular target of many diplomatic operations attempting to earn her hand in marriage and secure the Kingdom's inheritance. Most notabley, the Kingdom of Aragon and the Counts of Foix have made repeated attempts to earn her favor, but none have truly succeeded in reaping concrete results. But, we must decide how she will marry, if at all, sooner rather than later. This decision, however, will shape the future of Navarre."
 nav_iberia_focus.tt:0 "\nDue to focusing on §YIberian§! diplomacy, we will lose all cores not already under Navarrese rule in §YFrance§!.\n"
 aetas_nav.2.a:0 "Fine, marry the Aragonese prince."

 aetas_nav.2.c:0 "She can marry whomever, but her family name must be inherited!"
 aetas_nav.3.t:0 "Fuxéen Union"
 aetas_nav.3.d:0 "Just as we had hoped, the county of Foix and the principality of Béarn have fallen into the hands of the de Fois Navarrese Kings! Such a fateful inheritance will bring both of our realms great prosperity, or so we hope."
 aetas_nav.3.a:0 "To Foix! To Navarre!" 
 nav_branching.tt:0 "The contents of this §YBranching Mission§! will be determined by our §YChoice of Spouse§! for §YBlanka§!."

 aetas_nav.4.t:0 "Albretien Marriage"
 aetas_nav.4.d:0 "Much akin to the counts of Foix, the Seigneurs of Albret ooze with ambition and charisma, seeking to become the leading power in the south of France. To gain more prestige, they have asked that we name an Albretien as our heir due to common lineage and ancestry, and this young prince having a legitimate claim to the throne of Navarre. Such a choice would certainly bring our countries closer together, and a union for Navarre."
 aetas_nav.4.a:0 "Welcome the de Labrit with open arms."
 aetas_nav.4.b:0 "We will leave the succession situation as it is."
 aetas_nav.5.t:0 "Inheritance of Albret"
 aetas_nav.5.d:0 "With the de Labrit family rising to the throne of the Kingdom of Navarre, the very Kingdom has formed a union with that of the Seigneurie of Albret. Thus, does Navarrese influence and prestige continue to spread and grow in the south of France."

 aetas_nav.6.t:0 "Blanka's Will"
 aetas_nav.6.d:0 "  The tragic and unfortunate passing of Blanka d'Évreux, Queen of Navarre, raises the difficult question of proper succession after her death. She has willed that her and her husband's son, Karlos, be named the next king as according to Navarrese tradition. However, it would appear that her husband-consort, Chuan of Aragon, believes that it should be he who becomes King of Navarre instead of Karlos, binding Aragon and Navarre in personal union under the former.\n\n Aside from Blanka's will, there is no clear answer as to who should become king. However, the Agramonts have found it best to support the young Prince of Viana Karlos, while the Beaumonts rally behind Chuan."
 aetas_nav.6.a:0 "Accept Chuan's rule."
 aetas_nav.6.b:0 "Karlos, Prince of Viana, is the rightful King of Navarre!"
 aetas_nav.7.t:0 "Matters Gone Awry in Navarre"
 aetas_nav.7.d:0 "With the death of their queen, Navarre was expected to fall right into our lap as one of our own, Chuan of Aragon, might've been acknowledged as the king. However, the Navarrese estates have elected his son instead, Charles Prince of Viana, to rule over Navarre and prevent a union between our countries.\n\n  This is an outrage and an act of open defiance to the will of the Aragonese crown. Shall we punish them and restore Aragonese control over Navarre?"
 aetas_nav.7.a:0 "Justice will be delivered in Navarre."
 aetas_nav.7.b:0 "Leave them be; it is just not worth it."
 aetas_nav.8.t:0 "Privilege of the Union"
 aetas_nav.8.d:0 "  Although a historical settlement from the dawn of first human habitation of the area, Iruña still remains more divided than ever between her three principle boroughs: Nabarerria, San Nikolas and San Cernin. Rivalries and hostilities between these three sub-settlements were so extreme that stone walls were erected between each, further dividing the once united urban landscape.\n\n  Thankfully, it was by the intervention of King Karlos III 'the Good' that the ordinance known as the Privilege of the Union was declared in effect, united the boroughs and forbade the construction of such internal walls as well as defined the manner of governing the whole of Iruña under one city council. Thus, were these barriers torn down and the city breathed new life as it began to heal from its self-inflicted divisiveness. So influential was the Privilege of the Union, in fact, that it remained in effect until 1820, when another city council was formed."

 aetas_nav.9.t:0 "Fate of the Jews of Navarre"
 aetas_nav.9.d:0 "The recent Alhambra Decrees in Castile which forced all Jews within the Crown of Castile to either convert to Catholicism or to be expelled has send ripples and waves throughout the whole of Iberia, causing its neighbors to reconsider their own policies towards the Jews. Now, the Gorteak of Navarre deliberates with the sovereign on the question of Judaism within the kingdom, which has had a long and rich presence in especially Tudela. Shall we follow suite and force them into submission? Or will be continue to protect them as we already have?"
 aetas_nav.9.a:0 "Unfortunately, they must go."

While there are many other paths across the north of Iberia to reach the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, well over half of all pilgrims still use the French Way beginning at the Roncevaux Pass. Thus, is this pass and the town of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port not only extremely strategic but incredibly lucrative as well."

 pamplona_cat_mod_desc:0 "The Cathedral of Iruña stands as a testament to Basque national identity and the persistence and sheer resilience of the Kingdom of Navarre. On its grounds were two early Romanesque church complexes which date from as early as the 10th century when they were demolished. On the orders of King Antso Gartzez III Nagusia in 1097, the cathedral was reconstructed. It has since collapsed, been demolished, over and over, until it reached a stable form beginning in the 15th century by the patronage of King Karlos III 'the Good'. Since then, it has been the site of coronation for Navarrese Kings and Queens who bask in its looming stature and Gothic ambiance, as well as being one of the meeting places of the Gorteaka of Navarre henceforward, solidifying its place near the heart of Basque and Navarrese identity and culture."
 aetas_nav.11.t:0 "Arnaut Guilen Brocario" 
 aetas_nav.11.d:0 "A talented craftsman and engineer from inner Gascony in France, Arnaut Guilen Brocario introduced the first printing press to Iruña by 1492 with his first printing of 'Regulas' by Masparranthe. His work established a rich printing tradition in Iruña where he went on to publish several more works before being invited to join the campus of the University of Alcalá, the to-be literary capital of Spain."
 aetas_nav.11.a:0 "We are incredibly honored to host Brocario."
 aetas_nav.12.t:0 "The Reformation in Navarre"
 aetas_nav.12.d:0 " Although the Upper Navarre, the vast majority of the former kingdom, was under the firm grip of a Catholic monarchy, Spain, Lower Navarre was still ruled by Kings and Queens of Navarre. For several decades and during the devastating Wars of Religion in France, Navarre was a hub of Huguenot activity. One of its queens, Jeanne III d'Albret, was even an outspoken leader of the Huguenot league and became one of French Catholicism's most fiercesome and determined opponents.\n\n  And so, by [GetYear], Navarre must decide a course of action in regards to the most recent and intensive religious movements present in Europe: to join the Reformation and to adopt the Huguenot school, or to reaffirm our loyalty to the Roman Church and to promote the Counter-Reformation."

It seems that, however, Navarre and its Norman House of Évreux regrets such a deal and sends us a humble yet charming request to kindly return their ancestral estates in Normandy in the name of their family's heritage and potential legacy in their homelands. They would keep Nemours, however, due to Karlos II of Navarre's own claims in the Brie and Champagne regions."

Consequently, the estates of Navarre seek a strong enough dynasty to lead their realm and steer Navarre away from any further incursions from the Aragonese and the Castilians who seek to subdue the Navarrese. Thus, in highlighting the historic tradition of Occitan influence, they have approached our very own House of Albret and offered the succession of their throne to us."

Fueled by disagreements with one another, two powerful factions arose: the Oinaz faction and the Gamboa faction, each lead by eponymous clans.

Lately, this has noticeably taken a turn for the worst, as these noble families have begun aligning into two prominent factions: the Gamboa and the Oinaz. This development has left the general Basque area under our rule devastated due to physical violence arising between these two groups, and who knows when these petty nobles will put down the sword."

So much so that the people of the town and of Biscay had him thrown out of the settlement, not wanting his business and violence to spread any further than it already had. So, furious as he was, the Guraia lord set the town on fire and burned it down as a reminder of his power and sway over the region.

 aetas_cae.1.d:0 "  The Kingdom of the Canaries, a title granted by the Pope himself, was established on May 1, 1402 when the Norman Jean de Béthencourt conquered the island of Lanzarote in the name of the Castilian Crown with his Poitevin comrade and Seneschal of Bigorre, Gadifer de La Salle. From then on, with support from Andalusian cities such as Cadiz, conquest continued and the isle of Fuerteventura was too captured and made the seat of Jean's new lordship.\n\n While indeed this has been quite the adventure, Jean's heart longs for home in Normandy and operations in the Canaries have become quite expensive. To amend his financial woes, Jean now considers selling the lordship to a proper candidate and to move back to Normandy while his nephew, Maciot, remains in the Canaries to aid their new lord."

And so did a powerful rivalry arise between Don Enrique and Don Juan, and Enrique in his temper and boldness desperately sought after a way to guarantee his brother's downfall.\n\n Don Enrique's chosen method is known as the 'Coup of Tordesillas', wherein the Don kidnapped the young King Juan II of Castile in order to enforce a degree of control over royal affairs as well as convince Juan II to remove Don Juan of Aragon from any sort of power.

Thanks to his incredible efforts, Juan II fled the capture of Enrique and finally was he freed of the emboldened Infante. As a show of gratitude and friendship, Juan II promptly made Álvaro de Luna, a mere lowly nobleman, Constable of the Crown of Castile, an office typically only reserved for the most prestigious and honorable of nobles.\n\n Quickly after becoming free, Juan II was greeted by another Infante of Aragon, Juan, who had provided his extensive support to Álvaro de Luna in the rescue operation.

Most notably, they rebuilt the city of Tetouan, where a former Nasrid general, 'Ali al-Mandri established his own emirate in the name of the sultan. We have little choice but to accept his rule which envigorates the city of Tetouan."

 aetas_mor.10.d:0 "Even while the Wattasids were vizier, the Wattasid clan managed many of the internal affairs with the tribes of Fez.

He was also father to the future Lalla Aicha al-Alami, one of the most influential woman in the Maghrebi world and governor of Tetouan."

Because of Marinid weakness, the Sultans in Fez were not able to immediately strike back and retake authority. However, finally, has the time come for such an action, and the Hin Tata have effectively been subjugated and dwindled to being governors of Marrakesh and its surroundings in the name of the Sultan and of the Sultan only."

 aetas_gra.1.d:0 "Since Castile has begun felling the numerous taifa's of the former Caliphate of Cordoba in Southern Iberia and met Granada's borders, conflict has been at a standstill; the mighty hills and mountains of South Anadalusia provide a natural boundary, making conflict between the Emirate and the Kingdom drawn-out, long, and guerilla natured. The two, as a result, have reached a temporary compromise; while Castile has been busy with internal factionalism and Iberian politics elsewhere, Granada's existence is tolerated while they still pay tribute. The tribute Granada has to offer, however, is of great interest to Castile indeed, as they share much of the gold they receive from Sub-Saharan trade routes as their tribute to Castile, providing a solid source of wealth for Castillian coffers."

This is, in part, due to a lack of tolerance for their faith and forceful conversions to Christianity. Before it fell, the Emirate of Granada was the first destination for these refugees seeking to escape the grip of the Reconquista, and because of this, the population of the city of Garnatah swelled and became one of the largest cities of Europe and the whole of the Emirate hosted the most densley populated region in Iberia."

This ended a long period of prosperity for the island, as Cyprus was forced to hand over the power of trade to Genoese merchants."

However, the Basileus, as the final and ultimate authority over the Patriarchate at Constantinople, made his position very clear. The Basileus greatly desired such a union between Churches in order to strengthen ties between Europe's East and West, and to hopefully garner further support for the protection and independence of the Empire of the Romans, which lay now in tatters, ever closer to its final destruction. With our diplomatic presence now well known in the North of Italy, and relations established with the Pope, the Council of Florence has officially convened.

By the time Brittany was ready to join the conflict, however, it was already far too late with the devastating battle of Agincourt having already dealt the French massive losses.\n  The question of St. Malo remains, however, as Brittany did intend to help. Breton nobility thus argue that Brittany should rightfully recover the town without fear of reproach, for it is within its right and according to the deal struck between us and France."

Due to him being a close servant of Rome, and our benign relationship with the true Papacy there, we could pull some strings to have him make haste to Brittany and tour amongst the many towns within our Duchy, honoring us with hearing his practice."

Unfortunately, the prior passed away in the city last night, however, the clergy has arranged for his body to be buried at the local Cathedral of Vannes rather than transport his body to Valencia, his hometown. Of course, hosting a shrine to such a powerful man would bring great prestige and wealth, but the Crown of Aragon may be more than a little upset."

His career as the leader of the Earldom has not avoided drama, for he took great risk in marrying a woman well below his 'noble' status, and a Gaelic woman at that, Catherine MacCormac. Since 1366 as established by the Statues of Kilkenny, the Parliament at Dublin has outlawed the intermarriage between Normans and Irish gaels, making his marriage technically illegal although none of the lords respected the law.\n\nHowever, Thomas's uncle, James FitzGerald who himself is a son of the former great Gerald the 3rd Earl, has gained the favor of neighboring lords and of the parliament and is no blind man to opportunity; James has declared that Thomas voided his right to be Earl by marrying Catherine and should immediately step down with James taking his place.

It has been 9 long years since then, and James is still held hostage by the English King Henry V who has no intention of releasing him anytime soon without ransom. As he is forced to be a prisoner of the English King, James does indeed observe the styling of English Kingship and rule, which is much stronger there than Kingship in Scotland.\n In the meantime, Scotland is governed by his cousin, the powerful Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany.

He has struck a particular chord with one of these families, the Beauforts, a powerful family of English magnates. Without so much as a second of hesitaation, James accepted an offer of one of their young ladies' hand, Joan Beaufort.

These Norman lords, along with the Anglo-Saxon population of Lothian formed the core of modern Lowland Scots culture, which slowly overtook all of the Lowlands as well as the Kingdom, which became known as Scotland.\n  By the 15th century, and for centuries going forward, the culture and language of Lowland and Highland Scotland varied massively, with the latter dominated by local clans and proved to be extremely difficult to govern for both Scotland and eventually Great Britain, and took great amounts of reform and resources to bring under control."

Particularily in Florence does the Humanist movement take shape, being its intellectual nucleus due to the patronage by its Priorati and being home to some of the most influential humanists and literati of the time, including famous authors such as Petrarch and Dante.\n Simultaneously with the continued development of humanisn did Florence witness a flourishing and blooming of classicist studies, which is to say the study of Ancient Greek and Roman manuscripts. Among the most important frontunners of this movement was Niccolò de' Niccoli. Despite not having very many works of his own, Niccolò de' Niccoli was instrumental in the overseeing of the translation of dozens of important manuscripts into local Italian and heavily contributed to the classicist and humanist movements in Florence. His hand in the study of ancient literature cannot be understated, and eventually earned the official patronage of Cosimo de' Medici."

Despite the riches of Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici and the success of his financial institution, the Medici would not participate heavily in the politics of Florence until his son, the ambitious Cosimo, came to be the Gonfaloniere and Lord of Florence in 1434.\n Starting out as a priorati and powerful diplomat for the republic, Cosimo used all of his influence, connections and charisma to gain the prominent office of Gonfaloniere, the ninth of the priorati and head of state. His rule saw the rise of the Medici, and the spending of hundreds of thousands of florins in the name of patronizing legendary artists of the renaissance such as Donatello, of whom he commissioned the statue 'David', a stark beginning to the emergence of a new renaissance culture in sculpting. Cosimo became one of the most influential and celebrated lords of Florence of all time, defeating rivalling families in pursuit of power and establishing a prosperous and promising era for Florence."

Filippo Maria had the same ambition and drive that his father once had and a fire brews inside him to reassert Milan's supremacy over Italy. However, unlike him, Filippo Maria is found to be unnecessarily cruel and malevolent, thus would none dare to produce him an heir.\n Milan is full of hope and promise, with enough strength and ambition to make another push to control its neighboring areas.

The greatest of religious lawyers, scholars, princes and theologians, including Sigismund I himself, Pisan antipope John XXIII, and the Roman Pope Gregory XII are among those present at the Council. Although seeking to amend the schism, there was great difficulty in reaching a common verdict amongst those attending, and John XXIII escaped disguised as a messenger, but eventually returned.\n\n  Despite numerous setbacks, the Council and Sigismund decided that the best course of action was for each of the three Popes to resign, allowing one sole candidate to be elected. In a move which would enable the end of the Western Schism, Pope Gregory XII of Rome resigned his office, convoking the Cardinals to elect a new Pope.\n\n Meanwhile, though Gregory XII resigned and John XXIII's bid to the Papal throne effectively ended, the antipope of Avignon, the Aragonese Benedict XIII, still refuses to step down from his claimed position with the support of the Crown of Aragon."

 aetas_amg_vs_bur.1.d:0 "France, at the edge of despair, is yet vaulted into the abyss of internal strife and conflict stemming from the status of Regent for his majesty, Roi Charles VI, whose mental state has been rapidly deteriorating. Two factions of noblesse have arose to challenge one another for the control of the regency, and, thus, the crown of France; the Armagnacs, lead by the Orleannais de Valois and supported by a large league of Nobles, for whose benefit they seek to acquire control; and the Burgundians, lead by the powerful Burgundian de Valois and spearheaded by the mighty Jean I 'the Fearless', seeking to consolidate their own power from the mass nobility and from the crown in favor of the middle class. The only thing that is certain, however, is that neither seek to empower or maintain the crown. Rather, they mean to deal harm to royal power. Of course, England watches hungrily over the strife, eager to purchase the neutrality of both factions.\n\n Meanwhile, Charles VI and his sons watch in horror as their kingdom is torn apart from the inside and become pawns of an ever growing conflict. It is uncertain how the civil war will end, but all one knows is that violence is almost assured."

The Sultanate was consumed by wars known as the Fetret Devri, or 'Period of Interregnum', between these noble sons who spilled eachothers blood in the name of their claim to the throne, often without mercy or remorse. Midst the devastation wrought by these feuding heirs, one such heir rose to power. Mehmed I Celebi, governor of Rum at Amasya, challenged his brothers and for nearly a decade marched west with his army until toppling his eldest brother, Suleyman, at Edirne in 1413. Coated in the blood of fratricide, where his father had once ruled, Mehmed crowned himself the sole Sultan of the Ottoman State. Consequently however, his possessions had been completely devastated and exhausted by the violence, and memories of the Fetret Devri would haunt Mehmed I's following reign as well as his subjects."

However, after some consideration, Mehmed I concocted a plan to secure a more-or-less stable succession.

 aetas_ara.1.d:0 "Come 1412, by a twist of fate of Martin I the Elder's death, Fernando I, the co-regent and effective co-administrator of the Crown of Castile, became King of Aragon. In more ways than one, now, Aragon and Castile have begun to have their own destinies intertwined. However, Aragon and her Catalan crowns prove to be a handful for even the most careful and prudent of Kings. Although acknowledged as legitimate King of Aragon at Saragossa by the Aragonese parliament, Fernando being from Castile still poses some questions of loyalty and good faith for Aragon by his Catalan and Aragonese subjects alike. Now, must he not only continue being co-regent of Castile, but now too must he navigate the politics of the Crowns of Aragon and the contagious Catalan culture."

But, finally, in the 15th century did recovery finally shine through in the city of Valencia which paid witness to new pinnacles of Catalan culture, literature and economic prosperity during the Valencian Golden Age. \n\n  Beginning in the 15th century, the Golden Age of Valencia saw the city's population skyrocket to new heights to become the new economic heart of the Catalan coast. Writers and poets alike were all too common in the city streets, managing to strictly standardize Valencian Catalan and overcome outdating Troubadour traditions which reserved the right of poetry to Occitain. For the duration of the century and beyond, Valencia was the key destination in the Crown of Aragon."

 aetas_ara.27.d:0 " Due to heavily disputed elections and widespread corruption within the church, Catholicism has been consumed by what is called the 'Western Schism' for the last couple centuries, resulting in there being multiple Popes at any given time. These 'antipopes' centered their power upon 3 locations: Rome, Pisa and Avignon. While the antipopes of Rome and Pisa have resigned in order to unitarily elect one new pope, the antipope of Avignon refuses to give up his office. His name is Benedict XIII, an Aragonese known to us by his nickname 'Pope Luna'.\n\n With the Council of Constance in full swing thanks to the concerted efforts of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, there is a strong internal movement among all of Christendom calling for Luna's resignation so that the church may finally heal and move forward. Since he now resides within the Crown of Aragon, our word on his status would define the outcome of such a dispute. It may be advantageous to keep such a popular religious figure for the Aragonese and Catalans close, however denouncing him would repair our relationship with the ultimate Bishop of Rome."

The 14th century saw a dramatic increase in anti-Semitism in Iberia, with dozens of pogroms and brutal massacres of Jews throughout the Kingdoms as the re-conquista progressed further south.\n  The turn of the century saw Castile begin to address and reinforce anti-Semitic legislation through the cortes; in 1411, under the supervision of the regent, Catherine, in the name of the child-king Juan II, the Kingdom passed a law of 28 codes greatly reducing the personal freedoms of Jews under the Crown by revoking their personal right to own land and forbade them from forming relationships of much any kind with Christians, engaging in any craft or trade such as surgery, baking, practicing medicine, nor fill any sort of office nor position as a broker.

In these articles, Jews were not allowed to utter the names of Jesus, Mary and of any holy figures, they were forbidden from studying the Talmud, an important Rabbaic text, and the rigid reduction in personal rights of Jews enacted by Castile in 1411 was adopted and enforced by the Pope."

Quickly did these petty Taifas fall, however, to the Kingdom of Castile and her neighbors Aragon and Portugal, save one: the Emirate of Granada, ruled by the Nasrid dynasty, have managed to hold out in their mountainous region as an on and off tribute of Castile. Finally, has the last remnant of Islamic Iberia fallen to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], to whom the Granadan Sultan surrendered in Alhambra. Now, all of Iberia is in the hands of Christian rulers, something that hasn't been accomplished in over 700 years.

We cannot leave these prisoners around forever... The Reconquista has established a precedent of ransoming or making slaves out of captives, with many men being traded between the Islamic emirates and our righteous brethren this way. Whilst doing this without Papal approval would put us at risk of excommunication, securing the Bishop of Rome's approval would not only permit us to use these men as slaves, but would legitimize our advances as a crusade, bringing with it numerous benefits, and a right to any lands we seize. \n\nOur King, [Root.Monarch.GetName], has been heavily pushing for us to pursue this goal, so let us do so!

The last time anything remotely akin to this occurred was during the first Crusades, in the Levant! Whilst many Portuguese nobles encouraged the Portuguese King, [POR.Monarch.GetName], to leave the city in Marinid hands after the looting was done, he refused, instead establishing a governor there and a Bishop of Ceuta. Now, however, the Portuguese have come to us with a request to legitimize their seizure of Ceuta, and further conquests in the Maghreb, as a proper crusade, securing their claims as legitimate and permitting them to sell their captives as slaves.Whilst permitting this would, in a way, reduce our piety and permit an expansion of Portuguese influence across the Western Mediterranean, it would be helpful to have an Iberian power securing as a power pushing the Moors back, not only from Iberia, but from the Maghreb itself.\n\n Shall we approve this via a Papal Bull, the Sane charissimus, or shall we stick to the principles of Jesus and Saint Peter?"

However, due to lacking possession of Tangiers, the other isthmus-side city to her immediate west, their hopes of immediate economic effect are squandered.

The timing of the invasion, too, sought to take advantage of the disunity which was present within France due to the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War, a political power struggle over control of the regency between the Armagnac faction of Charles of Orléans and the Burgundian faction of Jean I le Bon of Burgundy.\n  With heavy hearts and blood boiling, the English Royal Army is prepared to secure a final victory against France in the face of numbers greater than they with the use of tactics and longbows."

These longbows made the English army extremely effective and difficult to break during the Hundred Years' War due to their high accuracy and piercing. However, towards the mid 1420s, the supremacy of the English longbow began to fade as French men-at-arms managed to slam one victory after another over them, breaking their line repeatdly and routing the English from the battlefield. Until then, however, the English longbow was as powerful as ever, and played an important role in the decisive English victory at Agincourt."

What was wrought, instead, was blood and destruction.

A victim of frequent 'kidnapping of the dauphin' carried out by both factions in the Armagnac-Burgundian civil war, Louis did not have the chance to show his potential, dying at the mere age of 18. But, he will always be remembered for his commitment to bringing about a peace during some of the darkest moments of the civil war itself."

 aetas_fra.21.t:0 "Inheritance of Valentinois"
 aetas_fra.21.d:0 "At last, the Duke of Valentinois Louis II de Poitiers has died at his Château at Baix. His reign was known for being enormously engorged by debt and a nearly 3 decade long dispute with the King of France over the possession of Montélimar. But, even by 1397, Louis II had already agreed to have his estates inherited by the King of France should he be allowed to rule peacefully until his death. While he went back on his promise several, several times, his domain finally arrives at the feet of the Roi de France." 
 aetas_fra.21.a:0 "Merci, Louis."
 aetas_fra.22.t:0 "Armagnac Rules in La Marche"
 aetas_fra.22.d:0 "Although a part of the Bourbon patrimony, the County of La Marche with Castres have maintained their own counts and countesses. The consequence of this, however, leaves the title vulnerable to outside influence and inheritance. As a perfect example of thus, with the death of the beloved Count of La Marche James II de Bourbon, the county falls to his sole heiress, Eleanor. However, she herself is married to the powerful prince of Armagnac, who now rules La Marche Jure Uxurois, effectively adding it to the Armagnac domains."

 aetas_fra.23.t:0 "Albretien Inheritance of Limoges"
 aetas_fra.23.d:0 "Due to a twisted turn of events, the line of Châtillon-Blois ruling over the Viscounty of Limoges has died out without heir. So, do all their estates go to the closest relatives, the Albrets. Already a strong presence in the south of France, such fortunes now land them as one of the leading magnates in the kingdom."
 aetas_fra.23.a:0 "We will use this well."
 aetas_fra.24.t:0 "Release of Jean of Angoulême"
 aetas_fra.24.d:0 "By a spell of good fortune, Jean de Valois, Count of Angoulême and a long time hostage of the English, has finally returned to French soil after 33 years of being held by English authorities. During his stay there, he spent much of his time reading English literature and poetry and spares no effort in its discussion and analysis. A keen mind, he is eager to retake his appanage and resume his duties as a Prince du Sang."
 aetas_fra.24.a:0 "Very well. Welcome home, Jean!"
 aetas_fra.25.t:0 "Bastard of Orléans"
 aetas_fra.25.d:0 "While on campaign with Jean of Arc herself, one noble made quite the name for himself in her presence with his valour and courage: Jean de Valois, the bastard of Orléans. Due to his growing popularity, it has been suggested that he be rewarded with some titles in recognition of his great sacrifices for the French cause."

 aetas_fra.25.b:0 "As if a bastard like he would ever be landed nobility."
 aetas_fra.26.t:0 "Remarriage of the Countess of Comminges"
 aetas_fra.26.d:0 "Familial love is one thing, but greed and hunger for power is another; since having the Countess of Comminges, Marguerite, marry his cousin, Bernat of Armagnac has held the both of them in his custody and left them to die in his prisons, hoping to gain the countess's estates for himself. However, by a miracle has the countess managed to escape his grasp in the night and flees from his cruel grip. Marguerite has since declared that she will remarry to a man of Foix, Mathieu de Fois, a younger brother of Count Joan I de Fois.\n\n  Ironically, what she doesn't know is that she will share the same fate she did prior with Mathieu, who will keep her locked up in order to govern her lands himself in the name of the Foix family. But, in spite of this, Marguerite managed to have her will written on the case of her death: that the whole of her estates would be ceded to the French crown upon her death."
 aetas_fra.26.a:0 "She wasn't worth it anyway."
 aetas_fra.27.t:0 "Death of the Countess of Comminges"
 aetas_fra.27.d:0 "The death of the poor Countess of Comminges, Marguerite, comes after an unbearingly long life largely imprisoned by her husbands. In order to make sure neither would profit from her passing, Marguerite wrote in her will that all of her property, including the County of Comminges, should be ceded to the French crown. And so, to France does Comminges pass in the wake of Marguerite's unfortunate circumstances."
 aetas_fra.27.a:0 "Well, that's that."
 aetas_fra.28.t:0 "Return of the County of Bigorre"
 aetas_fra.28.d:0 "Although a property of his parents, Count of Foix and Lord of Bearn Joan I had not seen the return of the County of Bigorre to his control for several years due to its occupation by the English and its subsequent reconquest by France. Since its succession was disputed between the Fois and the Armagnacs, the royal government preferred to hold onto it as a neutral party until it was determined exactly who would inherit the county. Finally, in [GetYear], the French crown deliberates to decide which of the claimants will inherit Bigorre: the Count of Foix and Lord of Bearn, or the Count of Armagnac."
 aetas_fra.28.a:0 "It belongs to the noble Foix."
 aetas_fra.28.b:0 "Armagnac is the rightful heir to the county I just know it!"

However, with the end of the Lazarevic dynasty, these gifts are now in the possession of the Brankovics, whose Despot, Durad, is a nephew of Sigismund. As these gifts were intended for a different family, it is deemed entirely just by our court to demand their return to the Hungarian royal domain.

Massive crowds gather throughout the narrow streets of Buda and to the square in good cheer and merry, celebrating the prosperity of Hungary and the good grace of our noble King! Only then did the guest of honor, King [POL.Monarch.GetName], did arrive. They quickly joined dear [Root.Monarch.GetName] for a toast, which then became two toasts, then three, then, unfortunately, the scribe lost count. In a drunken daze, [POL.Monarch.GetName] yells to our King, telling him that he'd do truly anything to earn his love and to keep their friendship forever. Although influenced by alcohol, a masterful plan comes to the mind of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Perhaps with some extra 'merriment', the plan could be carried out..."

Slowly turning his gaze to his right, although his vision hazy, he could recognize the good King [POL.Monarch.GetName] dreaming away in his slumber. However, in his hands, he clutches a document. Slowly, [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes it from his grasp, careful as to not stir him. Quickly, he whisks himself away from the hall to read the note; 'I, [POL.Monarch.GetName], with God and merry men as my witness, bequeath my throne to [Root.Monarch.GetName], so that he may-' the rest is rendered as scribble, probably due to the alcohol.

 aetas_hun.5.d:0 "It is with great sadness and grief that the news of the Great Zsigmond I's passing has come to your ears. Hailed as a Charlemagne, his effective leadership, despite the outcome of the Hussite wars, defined not only the history of the entire Holy Roman Empire, but too of Hungary and her surroundings. With his male line having died out, he left his throne to Albrecht of Austria, husband to his darling daughter Erzsébet. However, in these uncertain times, the powerful Hunyadi family of Hungary also offers their services as potential leaders of Hungary as being of her native blood, although, the consequences of such an action could lead to wars with both Austria as well as Poland. \n\nThe final choice, however, is up to the nobility to make, and they must make it carefully."

 aetas_hun.6.t:0 "Succession of Albrecht V"
 aetas_hun.6.d:0 "With the death of Albrecht, the tricky situation of Hungarian succession yet again rises. Albrecht's successor was not again a clear one, for, although he has an heir for his Duchy of Austria, the nobles of Hungary did not recognize him as also heir to the Kingdom of Hungary. \n\nThus, is the Kingdom left, once more, without a clear line of succession. Albrecht and his wife and Sigismund's daugther, Elisabeth, have bore a child. However, such a child was born after Albrecht's death, thus making him a far less of a strong candidate for the throne. \n\nHowever, the Jageillons still hold their claim to the throne of Hungary since Sigismund's death, and have the potential of swaying Hungary's nobility to allow them to become Kings of Hungary, at least for now..."

Thus, did the cities deliberate, choosing Arnold, Reinoud's grandnephew, as the new Duke of Guelders.

Having usurped the title from the rivalling von Luxemburg family, the von Wittelsbachs reached a new height in power and posterity as Kings of the Romans. However, this was not to last, as the King passed away in 1410, bequeathing his domains to his four sons. \nTo Ludwig he gave the most important title, the Electoral County Palatine. To Stefan, the ambitious Zweibrucken-Simmern title. To Otto, the Mosbach title. And finally, to Johann a title in Neumarkt, Oberpfalz. \nThough more divided than ever, the Palatine counts still appreciate the accomplishments of their father, and Ludwig especially, is eager to consolidate their inheritance and expand."

Being much closer to the junction of the Neckar and the Rhine then Heidelberg, Mannheim profited from its strategic position as an important stop for river trade along both streams which contributed to its quick growth.

Thus, do they refuse his right to the throne and seek to find another potential King tolerant of Hussites. However, the Pope has declared that the gross heresy of the Hussites has gone on for long enough, and has deemed a Hussite Crusade a righteous one.

Instead, several kilometers south, Jan has decided to found a new town to serve as his and his movement's stronhold, Tabor.

While the nobility seem more willing to cooperate and even adopt Hussite traditions, the Crown remains staunch in its approach towards the Hussites, refusing any compromise.\n Several years after Jan Hus's death, one last straw finally broke the camel's back: just a few days prior, the city council of Praha put forward a petition of requests for increased rights of Hussites and improve their freedom to practice and worship as they believe as well as an exchange for unnlawfully imprisoned fellows. However, such a treatise was utterly rejected by the royal institutions present at the capital, not allowing any sort of acknowledgement or mutual respect. In turn, the crowd which had gathered at the new town of Praha frenzied in anger and fear, becoming desperate under an increasingly discriminate regime. Driven by passion, several Hussite priests and peasants stormed the New Town Hall of Praha and, in a motion remember ever since, threw several members of the city council out of the tallest windows of the tower of the hall, killing them on their fall. The line has been crossed, and the Hussite Revolution seems to have begun.\n  Upon hearing the news, Václav IV was in utter dismay and disbelief. So in shock was he, that he had a heart-attack and died moments after such a tale reached his ears. And, thus, was Bohemia left in a difficult position without a true King."

As King of Poland, in his capacity as a great Monarch, is responsible for beginning what is considered to be the Polish Golden Age.\n\nHaving recently defeated the Teutonic Order in the Wars of Hunger, Wladislaw rules over a precarious and wide realm; to his West, the Hussites in Bohemia are creating a power vacuum which will inevitably consume all upon their current King, Wenzel's death. Although Wladislaw is indeed interested in the potential of seizing the Bohemian crown for himself, he must take caution, for he does not want to risk tarnishing his newly acquired Christian reputation with heresy.\n\nBesides, his hands are already full with an autonomous Lithuania, ruled by his regent, the Grand Duke Vytautas the Great. Although Wladislaw has Vytautas in line right now, the same cannot be said of Lithuania's nobility who may attempt to leave our present union upon Vytautas's death.\n\nDespite the present scenario, Wladislaw is determined to keep is mighty and vast domains together and continuing Poland's rise to becoming among the greatest powers in Europe."

 aetas_mam.24.d:0 "Since our conception and control over the Holy City of Makkah, we have been honored with providing the Kiswa, or Mantle, which is placed upon the Kaaba for holy rituals and prayer. However, since the invasion of Timur, the Timurids have usurped such a privilege by providing the Kiswa themselves, thus drastically increasing their local influence while reducing ours!\n  Finally, however, we have taken steps to undo such a catastrophe by gathering a council of Qadi and religious lawyers to denounce the Timurids and their lack of respect for our place in the ritual. Despite several of the lawyers abstaining, we have gained enough justification to safely remove the Timurid Kiswa from the Kaaba and replace it with our own, restoring our important place in the prayers of such a holy site."

The Mamluk Sultan now takes on a subtely divine and holy stature, claiming such repuation from the acknowledgement of the Caliph and his Mamluks, who owe him their lives and would die to protect him and his blood. As such, succession is no longer determined by the Noble Mamluks, but rather directly by male primogeniture due to the holiness of the Royal Mamluk bloodline."
 aetas_mam.25.t:0 "Reformation of the Mamluk Sultanate"
 aetas_mam.25.d:0 "Recent developments have lead to the cultivation of new reforms which could change the nature of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and Syria forever; as it were, the Sultan has grown quite close with the Abbassid Caliph, finding more ways to exploit his position to the benefit of his reputation. At the mean time, the Sultan and his Mamluks have become closer and closer, with their bonds being stronger than ever.\n  The Sultan can now choose to use his Caliph to grant him holy status, assuring his Mamluks of his divine blood and forever sealing their loyalty to his kin and dynasty."
