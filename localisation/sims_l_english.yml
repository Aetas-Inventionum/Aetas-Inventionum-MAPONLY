 aetas_brb.1.d:0 "Rumours of war are becoming widespread. It is said that the Burgundians have joined the English in a conspiracy against the French. Rumours which turn out to be true, if we were to believe the diplomat that arrived this morning. However, [Root.Monarch.GetName], still remembering the promise he made years ago, knows it is his duty to help out the French king. On the contrary, our advisors propose we help out Burgundy instead, as it is of importance we do not upset them. One thing is for certain; no matter if Brabant joins either side, duke [Root.Monarch.GetName] will not break his promise and fight among the French ranks."

This way he could, would he become prisoner of war, buy himself free cheaply because his capturers would not be able to recognise him. Ironically, not being recognised is exactly what killed him. His enemies did not realise he was duke, and thus, not knowing his value, killed him after they took him as prisoner of war. \nHis son and heir, Jan, is not very smart, in such a way that leaves us scared he is easily manipulated. It is of great importance to stay on a lookout of Burgundian attempts to influence him, or else dark times may be upon us."

Recent losses of land was the last straw for our nobility, and they have come with an ultimatum. The city council of Leuven called, on own initiative, the estates of Brabant together for a meeting. Back then, thinking that going would give the council any legitimacy, our duke was not there. The estates were furious. In an ultimatum they wrote “If we, the people of Brabant, feel like the duke is up to no good, we have the right to depose him, and re-place him with a Ruwaard.” Jan, ever a coward, wants to cave in, however the Burgundians want us to stand firm.

He was further influenced into making this decision by Filip the good from Burgundy, who had already built one in 1422. However, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had a hard time finding a city that was willing to commit to the task of building and maintaining a university. The student riots in Paris of 1419 had not really helped either, as Brussels denied fearing for student violence. The new plan is to build one in Leuven, as building it would give us many advantages. So would it be the first university in the low countries and, at least until another university is build, be the centre of knowledge in our region."

The countess of Holland, who has a weak claim to her thron,e is desperate to strengthen her position. Desperate enough, in fact, to come to our throne to propose a strategic marriage between our duke and her. \n \nAt home, she has all reasons to be desperate. The succession of Holland is not exactly clear, as it is uncertain if she, or Jan without Mercy, heir of Straubing will get the Hollandic throne on the death of Count Willem. With the Hook and Cod factions she needs our support to stand a chance in this mess. Par consequence, we would most likely also need help of the Burgundians if a succession war with Straubing breaks out. The reward is high, do we take the risk?"

Thinking to himself that protection of Holland is key, he picked his brother, not knowing that would be Hollands down-fall. The daughter of Willem, desperate to gain at least a little bit of power, has come to our duke. She has a proposal to make. She would like to marry [Root.Monarch.GetName], granting us a claim on the Hollandic throne. Should we accept, and make a push for Holland?

This is why they, after the death of Frederik van Blankenheim, proposed one of our loyalists as the next bishop He did not end up getting chosen, but the pope did gave him the rights to the bishopric. Zweder rebelled, started a schism and enforced his demands. With him also being the count of Culemborg this could be an unique opportunity for us, as he still owes loyalty to our duke. Utrecht must become our vassal, if we wished. Do we send an ultimatum, then invade, or let this opportunity go down the drain?"

This is why they, after the death of bishop Frederik van Blankenheim, proposed one of our loyalists as the next bishop. He did not end up getting chosen, but the pope did gave him the rights to the bishopric. Zweder rebelled and started a schism but ultimately lost the battle. Defeaten, but not deterred he has come to our court to ask for military support, in exchange becoming our vassal.

 aetas_utr.8.d:0 "After the rebelling Zweder was defeated, we naively assumed that would mean the end of the Utrechtian Schism. However, the cowardly anti-bishop fled to Gueldres and has somehow man-aged to convince their duke that he is, in fact, the rightful bishop of Utrecht. Now the duke has send an ultimatum demanding for Zweder van Culemborg to be installed as bishop or else they will in-vade."
 aetas_utr.8.a:0 "Never!"
 aetas_utr.8.b:0 "We must cave in to their demands."
 aetas_utr.9.t:0 "Walraven van Meurs"
 aetas_utr.9.d:0 "The Antibishop is dead! A moment of reassurance passes through our clergymen. This must mean God is on our side in the schism. Sadly Zweders supporters do not seem to agree with this sound logic, as they have chosen a different successor to the episcopal title. Someone who was also in the race for the title after Blankenheims death. His name is Walraven van Meurs, and from now on he is an enemy of the state."
 aetas_utr.9.a:0 "Like his predecessor, we will make him bite the dust."

 aetas_utr.10.b:0 "The Von Moers are the better option."
 aetas_utr.10.d:0 "Ever since [Root.Monarch.GetName] got hit by an arrow in conflict, worries in regards to his succession have taken arise. In our bishopric two rival families have been vying for power for centuries, on one hand the Von Hoya family, who control the county of Hoya, and on the other hand the Von Moers family, who control the county of Moers and since recently also the bishopric of Cologne. This particular election seems to be final confrontation between the two families. It might seem obvious to pick Walram, the Von Moers candidate as our next bishop, considering the far bigger international support for him, but he is also involved in the Utrechtian Schism, and lest we want to risk joining in we better not pick him. However, choosing Erik, the Von Hoya candidate, might not be so great an option either, as while he might enjoy the support of the city, that may lead to conflict with the neighbouring bishoprics. Whom do you choose?"

 aetas_utr.11.t:0 "An unexpected offer"
 aetas_utr.11.d:0 "With the recent elections in the bishopric of Munster, we expected for the Utrechtian Schism to heat up again, as our political archnemesis, the anti-bishop Walraven von Moers had won them. However, contrary to our believes, Walraven seems to have bitten off a little more than he could chew. In an act of desperation he has come to our court, willing to denounce his rights to our bishopric, in exchange for support, for he finds himself now also against an anti-bishop in Erik von Hoya. \n \nAdditionaly, in the episcopal election one of the nephews of [Root.Monarch.GetName] also ran for bishop. Therefore we to could lay claim on the Munsterian throne and attempt to subjugate them, which might mean the Utrechtian Schism lasts longer but we would also come out of it stronger."

 aetas_utr.12.d:0 "The gates of Munster, the city most defiant to Bishop [Root.Monarch.GetName], have opened. Our adversary in the Munster Feud has finally come to the realisation that he can not win, yet that alone was not enough to convince him to cave in. Our diplomats had to come speak to him in Kranenburg, and there he signed a treaty giving us the full rights to Munster in exchange for some money."
