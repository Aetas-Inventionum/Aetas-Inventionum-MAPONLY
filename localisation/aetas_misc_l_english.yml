 HUNDRED_YEAR_WAR:0 "Hundred Years' War"
 HUNDRED_YEAR_WAR_DESC:0 "On the 14th of August 1415, Henry V, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and wilful King of France landed in the Seine bay together with several thousand men, putting an end to the tenuous peace between France and England since the 1380s. While in England the king had the full confidence of his Parliament, France faced a breakdown of authority. With a volatile and unstable Charles VI, the Armagnacs and Bourgignons raged in civil war for the control of the nation's regency while a rising Burgundy simmered to the East. Meanwhile, the Bretons bide their time, waiting ready to take the path of least resistance. The fight for the crown of France has only just begun, and it is a crucial moment for every power involved."
 CONQUEST_OF_CEUTA:0 "Aftermath of the Conquest of Ceuta"
 CONQUEST_OF_CEUTA_DESC:0 "On August 21st 1415, a surprise assault led by King John I of Portugal took the Moorish city of Ceuta in Morocco. Ceuta's position opposite Gibraltar outlined its importance in the trans-African gold trade, as well as offering an opportunity to flank the most existential threat to Portugal - this crown of Castile. The attack, consisting of over 200 ships and 45,000 soldiers, was of merciless speed and left no quarter to the forces of Salah Ben Salah, rendering the Marinid sultanate defeated by the morning of the 22nd. Ceuta, now European, offered a new way forward. Before then, discoveries of new land were the stuff of adventurers but Ceuta marked a shift in state-organised maritime activity. This is undeniably the beginning of Europe's new age, in which all wrestle free from the last struggle of the Medieval Era."
 WESTERN_SCHISM:0 "Western Schism"
 WESTERN_SCHISM_DESC:0 "Since 1378, the Catholic faith had been in weakened turmoil between three separate popes. Over 40 years of schismatic papal allegiances had weakened the Papal State and King Ladislas of Naples took advantage of this, annexing almost all of the Papacy's holdings in Italy and even going so far as to capture Rome itself. However, his death in 1414 prematurely ended this age of conquest, sinking Naples into depression. In 1415, the Pisan pope convened the Council of Constance in a bid to reunify the faith and put religious harmony back into the realm of possibility. Meanwhile in the North, the death of the duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, left an inconsolable power vacuum between Papists, Imperials, and those under the Milanese boot. Italy is a region in change and turmoil, an opportunity to drive forward into the Renaissance and flourish should not be taken lightly."
 HUSSITE_REVOLUTION:0 "Hussite Revolution"
 HUSSITE_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "Following the execution of Jan Hus on the 6th of July at the Council of Konstanz, the elite of the Bohemian crown are in a state of religious turmoil while the Catholic emperor, Sigismund of Hungary, is a fierce opponent of the Hussites. They denounce the Papacy as a corrupt institute, crying for a reformation, and their defeat would be a boon to his credibility, having been devastated in the Crusade of Nicopolis. In North Germany, the Hohenzollern family have been elevated to Prince-Electorship after being sold the Brandenburg march while in South Germany, the Habsburgs begin their infamous rise. Among the myriad 'Roman' principalities, any one could wisely use this upheaval to their own ends."
 RISE_OTTOMANS:0 "Rise of the Ottomans"
 RISE_OTTOMANS_DESC:0 "In 1402, Timur's invasion of Anatolia ravaged the land and stole the Ottoman's momentum. In the power vacuum the Treaty of Gallipoli was born in which Byzantium recovered several Greek territories, while Venice and Genoa secured many coastal possessions. However despite this hit to Ottoman primacy the Bosnian King, fearing the loss of his power, beseeched the Sultan for support against Hungary and her allies plunging almost the entire region into a bloody war. Further east, Timur's devastation had been so powerful as to shift Anatolian demographics allowed several local powers - namely the Beyliks and Trebizond - to recover their autonomy grow strong out of the destruction. The whole region, from Budapest to Adana, has been set alight and every outcome is possible; who will rise in this game of Christianity and Islam, who will dominate all others?"
 UNION_HRODNO:0 "Union of Hrodno"
 UNION_HRODNO_DESC:0 "Just recently in 1413, the Union of Hrodno was signed between the Kingdom of Poland lead by Wladislaw II, born as Jogaila and was once a pagan Lithuanian prince, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania lead by the infamous regent Vytautas 'the Great' Gediminas. The Union grants Szclachta privileges to Lithuania's nobility, but nevertheless, the Grand Dukes still stand boldly and rebelliously in the face of Poland and seek to increase their independence in the future. Meanwhile, the Teutonic and Livonian orders watch closely by as the union's most dangerous enemies, ready to strike at the heart of Poland and Lithuania at a moments' notice. Evidently, in the early 15th century, the Intermarrium lacks the stability and unity it desperately seeks. Who will be able to bring together these divded powers, and soar as one of the greatest and largest powers of Europe?"
 TENSION_OF_KALMAR_UNION:0 "Tension in the Kalmar Union"
 TENSION_OF_KALMAR_UNION_DESC:0 "The Kalmar Union was the union of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, with the Danish Monarchs taking lead of the group. Despite the good intentions of preserving peace in the region with the newfound unity, the nobles of Denmark and Sweden are not so convinced with tensions escalating not only between the two as Denmark drains the resources of Sweden for her wars against Holstein and the Hansa, but also between these nobles and the Danish King Erik Gryf, known as the 'Pommeranian'. Further afield, on the edge of the known world, Iceland continues its more isolated existence as a vassal of Norway, carrying on its centuries-old traditions of the Althing. The fate of Scandinavia is all but secure, with Sweden eyeing independence from the union hungrily, and the nobility ready to oust the King Erik. Who will rise to the occasion, and bring about true unity and peace for the cold North?"
 BURGUNDIAN_YOKE:0 "Burgundian Yoke"
 BURGUNDIAN_YOKE_DESC:0 "The Low Countries are among the richest of all thanks to its farmland and location at the mouth of the Rhine river, granting them extensive monopolies over trade and shipping to and fro the North Sea and Continental Europe. It is for this reason that these countries are constantly under attack from the outside, and most recently, have caught the attention of the ambitious and resourceful Dukes of Burgundy who expand in the Lowlands unlike any prior, inheriting titles left and right and conquering what little they can't acquire through diplomacy and their coffers. Holland, Guelders and Luxembourg all find themselves in a panic, lacking proper and strong succession and Burgundy breathing down their necks. With the Burgundians encroaching in the South and the Great Frisian War waging in the North, It is impossible to tell who will next fall to the likes of Burgundy or amongst themselves, but those who can withstand the onslaught have the potential to be the wealthiest power in Europe."
 FRAGILITY_OF_MAGHREB:0 "Fragility of the Maghreb"
 FRAGILITY_OF_MAGHREB_DESC:0 "Amongst all of the regions in the world, none know the instability nor frequency in the changing of powers quite like the Maghreb. In the west lay the Marinids, who's power decays as it is corrupted from the inside out by the ambitious Wattasid viziers, ready to pounce at a moment's notice and take nearly full control the Sultanate in all but name, further paralyzing the previously expansive and prosperous Kingdom of Fez. Small embers of ambition still linger to its south, however, in the Sharifian dynasties of Sijilmasa and Draa, who bide their time in amassing enough strength to topple the Marin and unite Morocco. In the central Atlas mountains is the Kingdom of Tlemcen and to its own East is the powerful Hafsid Caliphate of Ifriqiya, eager to push their borders ever beyond and destroy their neighbors, reviving the Caliphates of old. With European Imperialism ever-pressing, it is unknown whether the Maghreb will be able to stand tall and repel their invaders, or if they will collapse and tear each other apart. Will the Maghreb ever again know its former peace and prosperity?"
 WEALTH_OF_HANSA:0 "Wealth of the Hansa"
 WEALTH_OF_HANSA_DESC:0 "While the Kalmar Union to its North occupies itself with inner tensions, the riches and expansion of the Hanseatic League of the North of the Holy Roman Empire is entirely unrivalled, placing great wealth into the pockets of ambitious merchants who fuel the local economies and industries of their respective cities. Growing ever determind to acquire even greater profits of trade, the Hanseatic League continues to expand to cities across Northern Europe without ceasing, from England to Estonia, lead by the cities of Lübeck, Hamburg, Bremen and Dortmund. Continiuing to butt heads with the Danish Kings of the North by supporting the rebellious Count of Holstein's claim to Slesvig, the Hansa are not afraid to test the waters and exploit the weakness of their neighbors. It remains to be seen, however, whether or not the Hanseatic League can keep up their recent gains, or will they fall to neighboring princes such as the Welfs, eager to reunite their domains?"
 STAGNATING_LEVANT:0 "Stagnation of the Levant"
 STAGNATING_LEVANT_DESC:0 "Although having been dead for many years and the borders of his sons having receded, the Levant and Anatolia still feel the shock and extreme trauma caused by Timur and his legendary invasions earlier in the century. Leaving thousands upon thousands of dead in his wake, both regions were heavily damaged economically and morally, with the Mamluks barely able to hold back his fierce conquests. At the same time, the Beys of Anatolia enjoy their independence while it lasts, as the Ottomans, beginning to recover for their civil war caused by Timur, begin to hungrily eye their domains, seeking to return them to the Ottoman fold. The future seems drab for the East, but hope still rests on the horizon for a new power to rise up and bring back its peace and stability."

 whaling: "Whales"
 whalingDESC: "Whale products were sought after for various purposes. The oil derived from whale blubber was used as a valuable source of fuel, especially before the widespread availability of petroleum-based alternatives.

Alum is also extensively used in the making of glass, tanning, and even gold and silver mining making alum a versatile and well sought-after compound."
 silver: "Silver"
 silverDESC: "Like gold, silver has been used as a standard of value over the ages for its precious qualities. Early into the Renaissance, shortages of gold in Europe led to the opening of many silver mines across Lower Germany and the Balkans. Furthermore, with the discovery of the New World, silver rapidly became a currency standard, which would have far-reaching effects when its export from the Americas was eventually exhausted."

Following the marriage, the Aquitaine region suddenly found itself within the sprawling Angevin Empire, which had a strong taste for quality wine but little other land suitable for intensive viticulture.

In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the islands were finally conquered and divided between Genoa and the crown of Aragon, bringing to their knees the ancient local Corsican and Sardinian fiefs.

Following the Council of Ephesus in 431, the Church of the East sided with Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople after his condemnation by the Council, leading to the severing of the Church of the East from the rest of Christendom. The Church of the East was weakened severely in the 14th century, when its followers faced fierce persecution, and by 1552 the Church was a shadow of its former self."

 waldensian_religion_desc:0 "Founded in the late 12th century, Waldensians are followers of the teachings of Peter Vaudès, a spiritual leader from Lyon, France. Waldensians are anti-clerical, and advocate a return to vows of poverty coupled with the practice of lay preaching, or preaching by people not designated as members of the clergy. Waldensians, unlike other contemporary movements like the Cathars, survived for centuries after the initial foundation of their belief system, and are considered to be one of the primary forerunners of the Protestant Reformation."
 lollard_religion_desc:0 "Lollards are members of the movement which came to be known as Lollardy, a movement based originally on the teachings of John Wycliffe and which laid much of the groundwork for not just other reformers like Jan Hus but for the greater Protestant Reformation in total. Wycliffe and his peers believed not just in the use of the vernacular in scripture - indeed, Wycliffe oversaw the first translations of the Bible into Middle English - but also in the doctrine of \"sola scriptura\" which would later underpin Lutheranism and other Protestant denominations. Lollardy's advocacy for anti-clerical reform garnered support from the peasantry and many academics at Oxford and elsewhere throughout Great Britain as well as from some members of the English nobility, who saw the confiscation of church property as an attractive way to gain income from England's monasteries. However, Lollardy would also garner much opposition from the Crown: in 1401, the law known as \"De heretico comburendo\" equated heresy with sedition against the crown and allowed for the use of burning at the stake as punishment for convicted heretics. While Lollardy would exist in small pockets until the English Reformation, the sect was forced underground and its influence waned heavily until then."
