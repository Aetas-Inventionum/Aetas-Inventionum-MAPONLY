There, he had a dream of a wolf, howling so loudly with the fury of a hundred of its kin. When Gediminas woke up, he was told that such an omen only meant one thing, that he should build a city upon this hill to be the new capital of Lithuania, and that by doing so would it be renowned by the entire world. So it is that the ancient Gedminas's Hill and the baroque Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania lays at the center of Vilnius, for it was the original hill which Gediminas dreamt on and founded the city upon."

 ai_diocletians_palace_desc:0 "The Palace of Diocletian in Split is not your typical palace, rather it is better described as the cradle of Split; built originally in the 3rd century on the orders of Roman Emperor Diocletian from local masonry and brickworks the city hosted Roman operations in Dalmatia. Since then, it has had a flurry of dramatics, from local Emperors visiting to assassinations. It was when the palace was sacked in the 7th century that it took on a new identity. When the community was attacked by raiding Avars, the townsfolk fled to the Palace and took shelter in its expansive basement. Since then, the people of Split have been living within the palace walls, sheltering them from the outside. Since this moment in history, the Palace has become the very heart of Split, with nearly all of its development remaining within the Palace Walls as its people live amongst the shadows of Roman history."

 ai_argesh_desc:0 "The Cathedral or Metropolis of Argesh was first founded in the 14th century, then renovated as a cathedral in 1517 under the supervision of Neagoe Basarab, Domn of Wallachia. The cathedral itself is surrounded in myth and mystery and hosts many stories about its construction. Legend has it that Radu Negru himself, the legendary founder of Wallachia, had his chief architect Manale design it. Radu Negru grew impatient with his progress, but to speed it up, Manale suggested replicating an ancient ritual of placing a woman inside the foundation so that the site may be blessed. The tale ends with Manole being forced to present his own pregnant wife as the sacrifice. Later on, when the Argesh Cathedral received its most impressive renovations in the 16th century, it is said that the designs of the Cathedral were drawn up by Neagoe Basarab himself while he was hostage in Ottoman Constantinople and was heavily inspired by their most grand mosques. Since its grand renovations, it has served as a mausoleum for several Domni of Wallachia, including Neagoe Basarab, and eventually several Kings of all Rumania."

Târgoviste, since even before the time of its Royal Court, was the up and coming center of Wallachia as an advantageous trade post. The Royal Complex, complete with a palace, church and wooden palisade, was a work of the finest of Wallachian architects, and it's beauty is to be greatly admired. Over time, it grew with the ambition of Wallachian Voivodes, with the infamous Vlad Tepes himself adding the Chindia Tower.
