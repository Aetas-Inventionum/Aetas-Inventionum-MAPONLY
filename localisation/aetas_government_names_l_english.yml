 upgraded_liber_augustalis_reform:0 "Reformed Liber Augustalis"
 upgraded_liber_augustalis_reform_desc:0 "The influential Liber Augustalis, or the Constitutions of Melfi, were first enacted and enshrined by Emperor Frederick II, King of Sicily and Holy Roman Emperor, in 1292 in order to begin a process of centralization in his kingdom and to curb the power of local barons and nobles who sought to reduce his control. For the next six centuries, the Liber Augustalis held massive sway and influence in both Sicilian Kingdoms where it remained enforced and more and more empowered over time."

 nueva_planta_decrees_reform:0 "Nueva Planta Decrees"
 nueva_planta_decrees_reform_desc:0 "A series of laws passed by Felipe V as the first Bourbon to reign on the throne, the Nueva Planta Decrees abolished the Crowns of Castile and Aragon as seperate and individual institutions and fused them together, equally, before the central government. Such decrees eliminated autonomy previously known to the Crown of Aragon, allowing for the creation of a truly Absolute Monarchy."
 aragonese_infantado_reform:0 "Aragonese Infantado"
 aragonese_infantado_reform_desc:0 "The various Aragonese Infantados in the Crown of Castile were the most powerful faction of nobility from the rise of Fernando to the throne of Aragon up until their defeat by the hands of Juan II of Castile and his loyal servant Alvaro de Luna in the First Battle of Olmedo in 1445. The Infantes of Aragon were known for their tact, political cunning and glamour in their expansive and luxurious estates."
 patronato_real:0 "Patronato Real"
 patronato_real_desc:0 "The Patronato Real consisted of the powers divested by the Catholic Church to monarchs of Spain to distribute and manage ecclesiastical roles in the New World as they see fit. Consequently, Spain gained religious hegemony in her American colonies and effectively micromanaged the appointment of bishops and the management of New-World dioceses."
 genoese_banks_reform:0 "Casa di San Giorgio"
 genoese_banks_reform_desc:0 "A closer relationship with the Genoese has allowed us unlimited access to their privileged banking institution, the Casa di San Giorgio, which provides us with favorable loans and financial support in maintaining our global empire."
 nueva_planta_decrees_reform:0 "Nueva Planta Decrees"
 nueva_planta_decrees_reform_desc:0 "When the Bourbons finally and securely landed themselves the throne of Spain, they found the domain in a decentralized bureaucratic mess. Modeling after the absolutist nature of the French Monarchy, the Bourbons forced through the administration a series of infamous laws known as the Nueva Planta decrees which abolished the Crowns of Castile and Aragon to ultimately unify all local government in Spain. The decrees ushered in sheer amounts of well needed modernization within the government, but, all at the cost of now empowered absolutism."
 beaumonts:0 "Beaumonts"
 beaumonts_FACTION_DESC:0 "Since the 13th century, the nobility of Navarre have been divided into two rivalling and powerful factions: the Beaumonts and the Agramonts.

The Beaumonts kept their powerbases in the Pyrenian mountains and were known for their more archaic-Basque traditions."
 agramonts:0 "Agramonts"
 agramonts_FACTION_DESC:0 "Since the 13th century, the nobility of Navarre have been divided into two rivalling and powerful factions: the Beaumonts and the Agramonts.

The Agramonts were commonly found in the fertile plains of the Ribera of Navarre along the Ebro river and were known for their estatic energy and dedication to the lowlands."
 remenca_reform:0 "Promote the Remensas"
 remenca_reform_desc:0 "Due to the power of the Corts and their hesitance to fund our maritime campaigns, monarchs of Aragon were quick to cut out the middle man and interacted directly with the source of the majority of their taxes: the peasants. Called 'remensa' due to having to pay a tax to leave their farmlands, royal correspondence and cooperation with the remança class resulted in a higher level of organization amongst the lower class than typically encountered in Europe. The royal crown even sponsored the creation of remança 'unions' in order to curtail the abuses of their landlords.\n\n§YGovernment Mechanics:§!\nEnables Peasants Estate"
 burgundian_state_reform:0 "States of the Duchy of Burgundy"
 burgundian_state_reform_desc:0 "The states of the Duke of Burgundy are an aggregate of several principalities governed by the same ruler, the duke of Burgundy, through personal unions. One singularity of this realm is that its territory is both composed of imperial fief and French apanages. The states of Burgundy constitute one of the major power of the region and acts de facto as an independant kingdom."
 duchies_silesia_reform:0 "Duchies of Silesia"
 duchies_silesia_reform_desc:0 "Ceded to Bohemia in 1335 by the Treaty of Trentschin, the Duchies of Silesia were over twenty divisions of the historical duchy that formed between the 12th and 14th centuries. They constitute Bohemian crown lands, perceived by the Kings to be one political unit although the reality was that of many local, loyal lords in conflict vying for the ability to represent the region for themselves. Each part of the Duchies, while subject to Bohemian rule, were state countries in their own right with their own legal codes -- through this they were highly autonomous, with their own armies, relations, and dynasties -- the Silesian Piasts."
 frenchfeudalism_reform:0 "French Feudalism"
 frenchfeudalism_reform_desc:0 "Feudalism in France expressed a particularly deep fragmentation of power. The kingdom consisted of counties and duchies, who then were also divided into smaller holdings ruled by lower lords. Further, the greatest of the realm's feudal subjects, known as apanages, developed an autonomous policy that rivalled the king's authority.\nThough it could be an effective tool for control and French self-preservation for some rulers, it was also a vast, confusing system that threatened the crown just as often. It would begin to dissipate in the 15th century as territorial acquisitions lessened the king's need to rely on vassals to quell dissent."
 judicate_reform:0 "Judicate"
 judicate_reform_desc:0 "As Eastern Roman influence filtered out of Sardinia, it found itself divided between four independent principalities known as Judicates with their own laws, administration, and emblems. Separate from European systems, it was a melting pot of Byzantine and Nuragic ways of rule. They were characterised by semi-democratic institutions comprised of castle lords or clergy, electing their own parliamentary assizes who would ratify acts and agreements. Thus, the judge could be dethroned or executed if they circumvented the bannus-consenus."
 cinarca_reform:0 "Lordship of Cinarca"
 cinarca_reform_desc:0 "Five families, all claiming descent of Ugo Colonna and known as the Cinarchesi, dominate the nobility of Corsica and acted in a game of rivalry to subjugate one another. To rule as the one lord of Corsica they had to fulfil three categories; be a Cinarchesi, possess the castle of Cinarca, and win appointment from the Assembly. Through this, they could claim hegemony through popular suffrage rather than birthright in the face of their supposed Genoan overlords."
 bretonstate_reform:0 "Breton State"
 bretonstate_reform_desc:0 "In the wake of Norse invasion in 939, the Duchy of Brittany rose from the ash of the Kingdom. Placed nominally under France, a modern state's structure was built throughout the 15th century by Dukes balancing French and wider European interests.\nA policy of patronage existed to justify their claim to sovereignty, to illustrate and assert their power by employing servitude from their own nobility and bourgeoisie the Dukes nourished the sense of a Breton Identity. Confidently, they sought all the attributes of sovereignty - from a permanent military to a national currency, even toeing the lines of royal crowning in Rennes."
 frisian_freedom_reform:0 "Frisian Freedom"
 frisian_freedom_reform_desc:0 "During the 9th-16th centuries, the Frisian region was marked by an absence of feudalism and serfdom with Freedom legendarily granted by Charlemagne or Charles the Fat, depending on the region asked. The landowners of Frisia elected 'Redjevens' to carry out political and judicial tasks, who were then managed by the Brokmerbrief - the Frisian law code - and would meet yearly under a tree in Aurich. The Frisians would also select a Potestaat to represent them militarily in the Empire. Later, two factions would develop known as the Fetkeapers (or Vetkopers) and the Skeiringers (or Schieringers) who represented the upper and lower classes respectively. They would come to a head in the Great Frisian War."
 hussite_elective_kingdom_reform:0 "Hussite Elective Monarchy"
 hussite_elective_kingdom_reform_desc:0 "With the Hussite Wars now won, the Nobility of Bohemia established a new, Hussite Elective Monarchy to elect New Kings for Bohemia. Although it is influenced by the neighboring Elective Monarchies of Poland and Hungary, Bohemia's was uniquely molded and shaped by the prior Hussite Wars."
 aragonese_monarchy_reform:0 "Aragonese Crown Monarchy"
 aragonese_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "Aragonese Crown Monarchy was a monarchy defined by the many seperate and powerful states it encompassed, each maintaining high degrees of legal autonomy and self-determination. The monarch often had to negotiate with the powerful Corts of both Catalonia and Valencia who each managed many of the highest affairs of the government and its administration."
 hungarian_elective_kingdom_reform:0 "Hungarian Monarchy"
 hungarian_elective_kingdom_reform_desc:0 "The Hungarian Monarchy has been characterized and forged by the many strong Angevin Kings such as Charles the Great to Sigismund I, who all concentrated great efforts into centralizing the monarchy while dealing with the ever-powerful nobility."
 wattasid_vizier_reform:0 "Wattasid Vizirs"
 wattasid_vizier_reform_desc:0 "The Wattasid Vizirs of Morocco hold total control and sway over the politics of the Sultanate. Each sultan is at the family's mercy as they dictate the government and pull the strings from their position as Vizir, all the while enforcing more frequent succession of Sultans in preventing any from solidifying power."
 moroccan_sultanate_reform:0 "Moroccan Sultanate"
 moroccan_sultanate_reform_desc:0 "The Moroccan Sultanate extended power outwards from one, Imperial Capital at its heart. Sultans governed Morocco by cooperating with local tribes, occassionally giving them loosely feudal Iqta lands, and appointing members of the Royal Family as governors. Each Sultan is aided in governing the Sultanate by his royal Vizier, a powerful administrator who helped oversee all government affairs."
 aviz_princes_reform:0 "Portuguese Monarchy"
 aviz_princes_reform_desc:0 "The Portuguese Monarchy was defined by the de Avis dynasty and her thassalocratic focus. King Joao I and his sons were some of the most innovative, scholarly and artistic of all princes of Portugal. King Joao I and his children are known as the 'Illustrious Generation' for their dedication in the pursuit of the humanities and sciences, as well as in exploration, which proved to be extremely profitable for the Kingdom. This unique identity of the Avis, along with an uncommon consolidation of power under the Portuguese King beginning with Joao I, set the stage for the Portuguese Renaissance and the Age of Discovery."
 holland_reform:0 "Reformed-County of Holland"
 holland_reform_desc:0 "The County of Holland's state has been reformed, following compromise between the Cod and Hook factions, and aims to coalesce the two seemlessly. Thus, concessions were made to both, creating a state beginning to resemble the well known Dutch Republic."
 dutch_wittelsbach_prince_reform:0 "Dutch-Wittelsbach Principality" 
 dutch_wittelsbach_prince_reform_desc:0 "When the Wittelsbach family first acquired the Dutch County of Holland, the impact was small and slow. However, as time passed, the Dutch culture and language soon became extremely contagious to her Bavarian rulers, who sought to immensely patronize the Dutch letters and arts. Consequently, after decades of Dutch exposure, the Bavarian Dukes of Straubing made the Binnenhof at den Haag their primary residence. However, these princes must deal with the local politics and struggle between the Noble Hook faction and Burgher-Urbanite Cod faction."
 aetas_hooks:0 "Hooks"
 aetas_hooks_FACTION_DESC:0 "The Hook, or Hoek, faction in Holland was a faction comprised of the upper class Nobility and Aristocracy of Holland and Straubing. They advocated for higher taxes of Urban dwellings, and to reduce the growing influence of Dutch Burghers."

 aetas_cods_FACTION_DESC:0 "The Cod, or Kabeljauw, faction in Holland was a faction comprised of the middle class Burghers and Urban dwellers. They advocated for higher support, grants and autonomy for Holland's many cities, and to obtain more rights and liberties from the reigning Nobility."
 romania_new_reform:0 "Eastern Roman Monarchy"
 romania_new_reform_desc:0 "Eastern Roman monarchy in all of its glory was filled with hundreds of efficient bureaucratic positions and offices each playing an important part of the efficacy of the administration of the Empire. Steeped in thousand year old tradition, the Eastern Roman monarchy has been made far more effective and modern in large part due to the Palaiológos Renaissance of the 15th century and the increased reverance of classicism. All the while, the divinity of the office of Basileús Romaíon continues to grow."
 romania_start_reform:0 "Late Roman Bureaucracy"
 romania_start_reform_desc:0 "The Late Roman government under the Palaiológos Dynasty was marred by excessive bureaucracy, and a lack of centralization. Still greatly influenced by Roman tradition, there is a clear lack in well defined rules of inheritance for each Basilieus, which in many cases warranted civil war and further division. However, given their current situation, the diplomacy and the tact of the dynasty is becoming a more important skill as diplomatic connections across Europe for support continue to unveil and evolve. Overall, the government is very blatantly flawed but with hope on the horizon for change and reform if it manages to survive."
 swedish_elective_kingdom_reform:0 "Swedish Elective Monarchy"
 swedish_elective_kingdom_reform_desc:0 "Sweden, through the Late Middle Ages, was absorbed with the politics of her Nobility who acted primarily as they wished, electing the Monarch and carrying out many, many privileges granted to them through irregular meetings of the Riksdag."

 guelders_quart_reform:0 "Quarters of Guelders"
 guelders_quart_reform_desc:0 "The Duchy of Guelders was divided into four parts, or quarters, each retaining its own unique laws and cultural identity. Originally, Guelders had the quarters of Nijmegan, Overkwartier, Veluwe and Zutphen, who all held high standards of self-governance within the ducal title. While such autonomy is normally less than preferable, it allows for us to levy more manpower than normal from these quarters in return."
 maarten_army_reform:0 "Reforms of van Rossum"
 maarten_army_reform_desc:0 "Maarten van Rossum was one of our most capable yet brutal martial officers who defended Guelders with all of his strength while terrorizing our enemies with his brutality. Although he is well known for his looting, his guerilla tactics were seen as revolutionary, and held Guelders's much larger enemies at bay for much longer, avoiding larger battles and engaging in smaller, armed conflict and ambushes."
 guelders_grand_duchy_reform:0 "Grand Duchy of Guelders"
 guelders_grand_duchy_reform_desc:0 "The status of Duchy of Guelders has been elevated to that of Grand Duchy, meaning that Guelders is technically superior to all Ducal neighboring titles, and is the primary leading title of the Low Countries.

 cyprian_monarchy_reform:0 "Cyprian Monarchy"
 cyprian_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "The Cyprian monarchy in the Kingdom of Cyprus is the carrying-on of the laws and legal traditions of the former Kingdom of Jerusalem. The laws of the monarchy are entirely based on the 'assizes' of Jerusalem, one of the largest collections of legal code compiled in the Middle Ages which defined the government of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The King of Jerusalem had the full right to dispose and replace of his vassals, preventing hereditary authority aside from his own.
