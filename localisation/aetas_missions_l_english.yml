 spa_cuatro_villas_desc:0 "The Hermandad de las Marismas was a mercantile brotherhood focused most notably in the cities of Santander, Laredo and San Sebastián on the northern coasts of Cantabria and Guipúzcoa. This alliance of cities was granted lofty autonomy in return for their excellent exportation of our greatest commodity: wool. Their ventures brought them from the Low Countries to England, France and even all the way around Iberia and into the Mediterranean to sell our wares.

The Kingdom of Naples, just across from Sicily, has always caught our attention as one of the most prosperous Kingdoms along the Mediterranean. Naples is ruled by a mighty Queen, Queen Giovanna, but it is with her that our destiny in Southern Italia lies. The relationship between our own Monarch with Giovanna has been much like one of Mother and her Son, with Giovanna tempted to even adopt our Monarch as her very own, making him the chief inheritor of the Kingdom of Naples. If we are able to navigate such a personal and diplomatic maze, we will be able to press a claim upon the Kingdom and challenge her more traditional successors. "

 ara_foix_desc:0 "Although the French Crown has tightened control over Occitania, there used to be a time when Aragon regularly challenged her control there, especially in the lands surrounding the Pyrenees.

 sav_order_saint_maurice_desc:0 "In the region of Savoy, there is one dominant patron saint: Saint Maurice. For his martyrdom and burial in our portion of the Alps has he earned the eternal reverance of our population and clergy, a fact well recognized by our dynasty. Perhaps it is time to found an order of our own: the Order of Saint Maurice."
 sav_antipope_title:0 "Active Retirement"
 sav_antipope_desc:0 "Amedeus VIII was a wise and crafty Duke of Savoy. So much so, in fact, that even upon giving the reins of the Savoyard states to his son, the Prince of Piedmont, Amedeus got himself into even further drama and intrigue as he was elected Antipope. Why not use this position as best we can to reap as much influence over the church as possible to our advantage?"
 sav_geneva_title:0 "Keep it in the Family"
 sav_geneva_desc:0 "Although we have inherited and control the County of Geneva, known as Genevois, we still lack control of the city itself due to its citizens' rights and bishops which advocate for their independence. However, should we continue acrruing further influence in the high Church in Rome, we could monopolize the right to select the bishops of Geneva, allowing our own family members and vassals to rule the city as our dependency."

 sav_golden_fleece_title:0 "Join the Golden Fleece"
 sav_golden_fleece_desc:0 "From our own beginnings, Savoy has kept close ties to Burgundy especially since our lands once made up a core region of the former kingdom. Since the establishment of the de Bourgogne-Valois have our states grown even closer to even being personal friends of the Burgundian Dukes. Thus, is it key that we maintain such a powerful Savoyard-Burgundian alliance and stay involved in their affairs. One such way to keep our connection strong is to join their newly created 'Order of the Golden Fleece', from which we could make even more connections and acquaintances."

 sav_nap_title:0 "Neapolitan Expedition"
 sav_nap_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sicily, once unified, has been divided between the eponymous island and Naples for centuries. Far too long, if you ask us.

From 1411, however, has this struggle for dominance erupted into war only resulting in a temporary treaty being signed in 1413. When that treaty is up, we must finish the job and invade the lands of Friuli to secularize the patriarchate."
 ven_aqu_title:0 "Absorb the Patria"
 ven_aqu_desc:0 "The Patriarch of Friuli has been nothing short of a true menace by repressing the will of his temporal subjects who wished to join our republic and violently clashing with us.

It goes without saying that it is not a fantastic location, but at the mouth of the Don does it serve an important mercantile purpose in trading with the hordes of the steppe for their silk and other fine goods. It may be worth it to solidify Venetian control over La Tana by developing it further into becoming a proper maritime hub."
 ven_gazaria_title:0 "War of the Straits"
 ven_gazaria_desc:0 "We have not forgotten of our defeats in the Black Sea to Genoa. With the rise of La Tana, our fleet is confident that should we once again confront Genoa that we could annihilate their forces and seize their colonies in the east.

 ven_scuole_grandi_title:0 "Scuole Grandi"
 ven_scuole_grandi_desc:0 "The scuole grandi of Venice was a humane society and fraternity of several different institutions aimed at improving the quality of life in the city. These scuole grandi were responsible for distributing money to the poor and to the public at large, providing financial support to their less financially successful members and to securing a pathway for each and all to 'live life virtuosly'. The Venetian government is often found collaborating with the scuole grandi, and so again shall we extend our hand."
 ven_aldine_title:0 "Sponsor Aldine"

But, should it come to it, we must be prepared to launch a full-scale invasion of the kingdom."
 ven_mam_title:0 "Enemy of my Enemy"
 ven_mam_desc:0 "Not far from the ports of Cyprus is the mighty and massive Mamluk sultanate, the primary rivals of the accursed Ottoman Empire. Although they shared less than warm relations with Cyprus prior, we may be able to come to some sort of agreement with them seeing as they are also enemies of the Turk. Indeed it is as they say 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend'."
 ven_alexandria_title:0 "Asking Alexandria"
 ven_alexandria_desc:0 "Legendary Alexandria, cloaked in myth and classical history, is deeply ingrained in the stories of Venice due to being the original resting place of our patron saint, Saint Mark, who now resides in Venice. Being the primary port for the transporting of exotic goods from Egypt, solid control of Alexandria is crucial for Venice to continue its growth. Let's roll the dice, and see if the Mamluks would be willing to part with the city in return for a large sum of ducats and a contractual trade agreement."

 bur_utr_desc:0 "Our now neighbor, the Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht, has repeatedly resisted our advances to the detriment of our influence there. They must realize that such debauchery has its consequences, and we will not fail to engorge ourselves in Utrecht and have one of our own, the illegitimate son David, made their Prince-Bishop!"
 bur_hooks_cods_title:0 "Of Hooks and Cods"
 bur_hooks_cods_desc:0 "Currently,  the County of Holland is beset by extreme factionalism and inner conflict: the Hook and Cod wars.

 bur_lux_title:0 "A Widow's Debt"
 bur_lux_desc:0 "The Duchy of Luxembourg, neglected by her more noble kin in Hungary and Bohemia, is ruled by Elisabeth 'of Gorlitz'.

 bur_netherlands_title:0 "Burgundian Netherlands"
 bur_netherlands_desc:0 "The Burgundian Netherlands were an agglomeration of sovereign entities comprising the majority of the Low Countries each ruled over by the Duke of Burgundy. A primary source for our power and income, the whole of the Low Countries must be seen to joining our vast sphere of influence."
 bur_great_privilege_title:0 "Reign of Marie"
 bur_great_privilege_desc:0 "The succession of Burgundy has placed the young but talented and ambitious heiress, Marie, at the seat of the helm of our powerful duchy. But, since our neighbors vie for influence and even control over our duchy due to our female monarch, it is more important than ever that we earn the permanent loyalty of our states in the Low Countries. To that effect, we must consider enacting the 'Great Privilege'."
 bur_gel_succession_title:0 "Guelderian Succession"

 bur_cbm_desc:0 "Finding itself on the edge of the Holy Roman Empire and on the border with France, the destiny of Cambrai is far from certain. To do away with the fears of their populace, we will be their champions and insist that they accept a Burgundian Bishop and become a protectorate."
 bur_besan_title:0 "Guardian of Besançon"
 bur_besan_desc:0 "Besançon is the free city of great privilege, laying within our Burgundian County holdings. While the city is prosperous, it is completely surrounded by our territory and is thus, heavily reliant on our trade and support. It would be extremely easy to demand feudal privilege from the city, as it is already so. "
 bur_sundgau_title:0 "Treaty of Saint-Omer"
 bur_sundgau_desc:0 "The Habsburgs have made it clear that their holdings in Further Austria have little value to them.

 bur_lie_title:0 "Liégois Resistance"
 bur_lie_desc:0 "Much akin to Utrecht, the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and its citizens are not content with being a Burgundian protectorate. They are extremely foolish, for we are the only ones who could ever guarantee their safety. Therefore must we teach them a lesson they'll never forget..."

The status quo continues, and let us remind Mainz of our hatred of their greed."
 hes_pad_title:0 "Protection of Paderborn"

 hes_lpp_title:0 "Fealty of Lippe"

 hes_spessart_title:0 "Burn the Spessart"
 hes_spessart_desc:0 "The forest of the Spessart provides Mainz the well needed supplies of lumber and paper as well as a large amount of its territory. To burn the forest and conquer the region would mean crippling the Archbishopric , and soon, spell the end for Mainz."

 hes_hersfeld_desc:0 "Every so often do our princes visit the abbey of Hersfeld in our province of Homsberg to bask in its beautiful courtyard and enjoy the fresh air. Our Princes are now interested in providing full patronage to the Abbey and promoting its prestige and, most importantly, its superiority to the nearby Abbey of Fulda."
 hes_fld_title:0 "Victory in Fulda"
 hes_fld_desc:0 "The Prince-Abbacy of Fulda is vulnerable to extensive influence from the cursed Archbishops of Mainz, and have taken their side in numerous conflicts between our two parties. Clearly, Fulda requires Hessian intervention to liberate them from the overarching, corrupting influence of Mainz."
 hes_erf_title:0 "Allegiance of Erfurt"
 hes_erf_desc:0 "We cannot help but feel for the city of Erfurt, who have had long to endure submission to the Archbishops of Mainz. Let us make contacts within the settlement, and see if they would be willing to abandon their chains and rather seek secular liberty with us."
 hes_thu_title:0 "Where it All Began"
 hes_thu_desc:0 "The origin of the Langraviate of Hesse lays within Thuringia, from whom we have inherited our most unique title of 'Landgraf'. It is there that we shall return and press our historical claim to the Landgraviate of Thuringia."

 hes_ktz_ally_title:0 "Feline Diplomacy"
 hes_ktz_ally_desc:0 "The Counts of Katzenelnbogen are as charistmatic and charming as they come; they being, too, natural enemies of Mainz and our other feuding neighbors the Cat could prove to be an invaluable ally and an asset to Hesse."
 hes_ktz_title:0 "Fortunes of Katz"
 hes_ktz_desc:0 "The County of Katzenelnbogen offers a wide variety of economic wealth and good fortunes; their success would be a most optimal addition to our domains, so must we seek, through diplomacy and marriage, a method to acquire their good profits."
 hes_rhine_title:0 "Exact Rhine Tolls"
 hes_rhine_desc:0 "Katzenelnbogen's adjacency to the powerful Rhine river previously allowed the county to enforce their own system of tolls on incoming and outgoing merchant activity.

 hes_guilds_desc:0 "The lands of Hesse do not have the luxury of bountiful natural resources as many other regions of Germany do, but what we do possess is a talented community of artisans and craftsmen, though they lack support from the royal establishment.

 hes_kassel_title:0 "Royal Kassel"
 hes_kassel_desc:0 "Kassel, since the foundation of the Landgraviate of Hesse, has served as the sole capital and embodiment of Hesse.

 hes_primogeniture_desc:0 "The advantages primogeniture hold would be of immeasurable benefit to our prestigious Landgraviate in not only allowing us to better control the distribution of inheritance to one sole heir, but also to justify the centralization of our state."
 hes_landeskinder_title:0 "Landeskinder Reform"

 hes_army_title:0 "Professional Army"
 hes_army_desc:0 "So often are we forced into violent conflict with our neighbors that we have culminated a strong military tradition within Hesse. This military is that which guards our domain, and it must continue to be improved."
 hes_mercs_title:0 "Lend our Services"
 hes_mercs_desc:0 "The advancement and rigorous discipline of our army has attracted many outsiders seeking to request our services as mercenaries.

 wur_mbd_title:0 "Inheritance of Montbéliard"
 wur_mbd_desc:0 "The County of Montbéliard, or Mömpelgard as it is known in our native tongue, has been in personal union with Württemberg since the marriage of our heir, Eberhard, with their Countess, Henriette de Montfaucon. Since Eberhard is the co-ruler of Mömpelgard with his spouse, his succession to the throne of Württemberg would also spell a closer relationship and binding of the County of Montbéliard with Württemberg."
 wur_family_title:0 "Family Affair"
 wur_family_desc:0 "As ever with Swabian nobility, our family is large and splendid. This brings about problems of inheritance, however, as brothers demand their fair share of the wealth.

 wur_ehrbarkeit_title:0 "Standardize the Ehrbarkeit"
 wur_ehrbarkeit_desc:0 "Ehrbarkeit, known as 'respectability' is the fundamental belief of mutual respect between a prince and his estates. Ehrbarkeit plays an important role in Swabian politics and society, so must it be embraced and standardized in our country."
 wur_oberrat_title:0 "Institute the Oberrat"
 wur_oberrat_desc:0 "The evolution of our government requires a strong legal authority; a new obberamt, an institution which represents the highest legal authority aside from the monarch, could prove useful in such an endeavor and leave both our monarch and our estates satisfied with their roles."
 wur_baroque_title:0 "Baroque Monarchy"
 wur_baroque_desc:0 "The prestige and eloquence of the baroque and rococo movements have greatly inspired our Dukes to attempt the unthinkable: enact an absolute monarchy. Such a move would drastically improve the efficiency of our government, as all power will stem from the Württemberger monarch and them alone."
 wur_ludwigsburg_title:0 "A Worthy Palace"
 wur_ludwigsburg_desc:0 "What good is absolute power if one does not put it on full display? With that in mind, a new palace to house our new, absolutist monarchy is needed to embody our power on earth and our right to rule.

 wur_hel_desc:0 "The Imperial Free City of Heilbronn, in fear of our ambition, has concluded an alliance with the rivalling Electoral Palatinate. This interference in our local affairs has a high cost, and so shall we level the city and bring it under Württemberger control."
 wur_religion_title:0 "Respond to the Reformation"
 wur_religion_desc:0 "Although the reformation has gained large amounts of popularity amongst Swabians, we cannot determine whether or not it is truly the best course of action to convert; we must weigh all of our options, and only choose what is best and most natural for our subjects."

 wur_church_codes_title:0 "Great Church Order"
 wur_church_codes_desc:0 "The reformation presents us with an opportunity to further centralize another aspect of Württemberg in that we may justifiably take full control of the church and their property thereof.

 wur_catholic_desc:0 ""
 wur_army_title:0 "Raise an Army"
 wur_army_desc:0 "Our state's central location in Swabia has us surrounded by potential rivals and enemies, all seeking to exploit the wealth and strength of Württemberg. It is a shame for them, however, that we do not plan on giving in to their petty ploys, but rather grow even more resilient; it goes without saying that such resilience requires the backing of a powerful and fully-equipped army."
 wur_urc_title:0 "Urach Offices"
 wur_urc_desc:0 "Urach has become an important holding within our dominion for being a secondary site of our central government agencies. As such, the town is well deserving of being endowed with special city rights as well as receiving our most grand of patronage."
 wur_stuttgart_title:0 "Old Stuttgart"
 wur_stuttgart_desc:0 "Stuttgart has been the capital of Württemberg since we first came down from the hill castle of Wirtemberg, our ancestral seat just neighboring the city.

To keep up with the latest trends, let us embue old Stuttgart with the beauty and sophistication of the renaissance!"
 wur_reu_title:0 "Parlay with Reutlingen"
 wur_reu_desc:0 "Being surrounded by our holdings, the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen knows well that they are, at the end of the day, reliant on our protection.

 wur_rtw_title:0 "Rottweiler Intervention"
 wur_rtw_desc:0 "The city state of Rottweil has lately been tempted by Swiss offers to join their confederacy. This is unacceptable for all the principalites and cities of Swabia and intervention against them must be swiftly taken!"
 wur_league_title:0 "Form Swabian League"

 wur_ulm_title:0 "Rule of Ulm"
 wur_ulm_desc:0 "There is one primal city within Swabia who claims leadership of all her Imperial Free Cities, and that is the expansive city of Ulm. Ornamented with her massive minster, Ulm has countless of times spat in our face for attempting to expand our power in the region. Well no more will we allow them the benefit of independence, for we will take the initiative and conquer their domain ourselves!"
 wur_aug_title:0 "Induct Augsberg"
 wur_aug_desc:0 "The city and Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg play an invaluable role in the way of trade between Italy and Swabia and Bavaria. Being Swabian, the city would be yet an important component to our duchy."
 wur_swa_title:0 "Ducatus Allemaniæ"
 wur_swa_desc:0 "The Duchy of Swabia has not been unified since the late 13th century, giving way to dozens upon dozens of independent principalities and free imperial cities.

 wur_hab_title:0 "Expel Habsburgs"
 wur_hab_desc:0 "Although they are known to collaborate with us, the von Habsburgs of Austria are in fact our paramount rivals to the title 'Duke of Swabia'. From behind the scenes have they actively prevented us from acquiring the title, as it would be to their expense for they seek to forever maintain a level of sway in our imperial circle being the last holders of the Swabian title. Certainly, these ruffians must be expelled from Swabia and her neighboring lands once and for all."
 wur_mem_title:0 "Allure of Memmingen"

 swa_staufen_title:0 "Staufen Shadow"
 swa_staufen_desc:0 "We are well aware of the history which the Duchy of Swabia holds, and the most striking of its proud story is undoubtably the line of Hohenstaufen Emperors, who lead the Holy Roman Empire to new heights of glory. It is fully within our rights to echo their aspirations in leading all of the Holy Roman Empire, and perhaps in taking their name and citing our lineage to them could we gain more stature and reputation."
 swa_sic_title:0 "Kings of Sicily"

 mam_druze_title:0 "Iqta of the Druze"

 mam_centralize_levant_desc:0 "With the most key cities of Syria now patronized and heavily invested in by our Sultanate, we must take the leap and pursue an even greater closeness between our ruling administration and the Levant, forever banishing the opportunity for local Emirs to permanently influence affairs in there and grant us truly direct control."

 mam_levantine_port_desc:0 "Since the burning of some of the major harbors in Palestine by our Sultans in order to prevent any more incursions by potential crusaders, the maritime ports of the Levant have been less than prosperous and have gone without central investment for quite some time.

 mam_beja_vassal_desc:0 "The tribes of Beja have been naught but a nuissance on our frontier with them, encouraging the rowdy behavior of many townships along our border as well as raiding and massacring pilgrims. Enough is enough, we can no longer stand for such disobedience of good faith."

While we typically elect a mamluk of a prior Sultan's retinue, some Sultans still attempt have have their sons installed as Sultan.

 mam_aydhab_desc:0 "The port of 'Aydhab has dramatically grown in importance over the course of the Middle Ages. But, things have come to a standstill, and the village searches for other means of income.

 mam_suakin_title:0 "Recapture Sawakin"
 mam_suakin_desc:0 "The port of Sawakin to the South of former 'Aydhab was once a key center of Mamluk control along the Red Sea, though now it is overrun by Beja tribes. We must seize the opportunity to conquer this port and return to these long lost shores."

 mam_yem_desc:0 "The Banu Rasul dynasty's origin spans to the time of Ayyubid occupation in Yemen, where they, fellow Kurds with the Ayyubiyun, were installed as Yemen's governors. With the fall of the dynasty have they been independently operating in Yemen with varying degrees of success, however, of late, their Sultanate is at the brink of collapse at even the slightest sign of weakness in the Sultan. We must intervene in the name of regional stability and secure Yemen as a core holding of our Mamluk Sultanate."
 mam_tim_title:0 "Take Back the Kiswa"
 mam_tim_desc:0 "The privilege of providing the Kiswa, the cloth that is hung over the Rock at Mecca, has long been the duty of the Custodian of the Holy Cities, which we are.

 mam_hajj_title:0 "Master of the Hajj"
 mam_hajj_desc:0 "The Sharifates having been centralized opens up many a door to further bringing closer these entities as well as better guarding the Hajj caravans along the way.

 mam_gambit_title:0 "Imperial Gambit"

 mam_cyprus_title:0 "Invade Cyprus"
 mam_cyprus_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Cyprus stands as a decrepit and decaying relic of the failed Christian Crusades, who's Monarch still crowns themselves King or Queen of Jerusalem.

 mam_kni_title:0 "Expedition to Rhodes"

 mam_kar_title:0 "Karamanid Standing"
 mam_kar_desc:0 "The Beylik of Karaman is one of the most important powers south of the Ottomans in Anatolia. Due to frequent participation in their politics, they have become more than accustomed to Mamluk amirs being active in their affairs. We must renew such participation in their politics immediately and ensure that they are not just fodder to Ottoman expansion."
 mam_ali_title:0 "Rights to Alaiye"
 mam_ali_desc:0 "It has reached our ears that the Beylik of Alaiye, the vassal of Karaman, is up for coin to the highest bidder. As we seek to expand our influence in Anatolia, purchasing the Beylik would certainly help improve our presence there."
 mam_aegean_title:0 "Aegean Expansion"

 mam_ram_title:0 "Embassy in Adana"
 mam_ram_desc:0 "The Beys of Ramazan have been all too eager to attempt to wittle down our influence, despite the fact that we allowed them to settle there in the first place.

 mam_ram2_title:0 "Fealty of Ramazan"
 mam_ram2_desc:0 "The time has come, and Ramazan must declare its fealty to the Mamluk Sultan as it has before and most naturally become a loyal fief to al-Qahirah. How we go about this, however, remains up to them."
 mam_dul_title:0 "Competition over Marash"
 mam_dul_desc:0 "The Beylik of Dulkadir is another of those whose origins lay in their appointment by Mamluk Sultans.

 cyp_gen_title:0 "Diplomacy with Genoa"
 cyp_gen_desc:0 "Time and time again have the Genoese never failed to take advantage of us in competing for total influence over our trade with Venice.

 cyp_mam_title:0 "Approach the Mamluks"
 cyp_mam_desc:0 "The cruel Mamluks spared no time in driving out all the Latin-Christian communities in the Levant, including us. As Frederick did with the Ayyubids, we must consider establishing good diplomacy with the Mamluks over the peaceful posession of Acre and Jerusalem."

A smart Earl, he was quick to balance the status of Hiberno-Norman and Gaelic, effectively synchronizing the two within his Earldom; while he still attended Parliament in Dublin where he spoke Anglo-Norman he wrote poetry in Gaelic at home in Desmond, strengthening the Gaelic elements of our line of Geraldines. His legacy is that of poetry, legend and a powerful idea of Gaelic-Norman synergy which prompted the saying 'more Irish than the Irish themselves'. With our Earls now following his footsteps in attaining a higher level of absorbtion of Gaelic culture, we should now emulate Gearóid Iarla and sponsor the arts, letters and culture of Gaelic Ireland as much as that of our own Hiberno-Norman kin."

Over the centuries, the connection between our people and Kievan Rus has become loose at best.\nHowever, the Russians of Muscovy have proven to be a formidable threat.

 swe_lord_of_eastern_europe_desc:0 "The Varangians, our ancestors, were once the rulers of Eastern Europe. They established a trade route from Sweden all the way to Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Romans, in the 10th century. Over time, the Varangians eventually became the Kievan Rus, and the connection between Sweden and Greece dissolved as more and larger groups of interests found their way into Eastern Europe.\nAlthough we do not have any historical claims on Eastern Europe anymore, the trade routes of the old times still exist.

On the one hand it might be worth trying to get our dynasty onto their throne, while on the other hand the Kingdom of Poland might become a strategic and reliable ally against the Russians and the Holy Roman Empire.\nAlternatively, we could conquer them the old fashion way and be one of many others who claim the valuable Polish lands for themselves."

The first two times, the petty missionaries failed to divert us from Odin's glory.\nEventually though, the missionaries found a king who was willing to sell his place in Valhalla in his pursuit of power. King Olof Skötkonung got himself baptized in Husaby. He tried to destroy the sacred Temple at Uppsala, but his own people - the ones who stayed true to the Norse ways - resisted him.\nOne century later, King Inge the Elder managed to destroy the temple and left nothing but rubble. With that, the full Christianization of Sweden was only a question of time.\nAs we have finally returned to our Norse legacy, it is time to restore the religious temples and buildings for the glory of our Gods."

Eventually, in 1426, their audacity led to an open war between Denmark and the Hansaetic League.
